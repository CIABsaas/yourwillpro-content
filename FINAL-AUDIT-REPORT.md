## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Restructure the 8 URGENT entries first** - These have structural issues (missing Legal Definition, When you'll encounter) AND are 5-9x too long

2. **Condense the 40 CRITICAL entries** - Cut these from 1,000-2,500 words down to 250-400 words maximum

3. **Add missing Examples** to 138 entries - Use the Administrator format: one simple sentence in quotes

4. **Add Related Terms** to 138 entries - Link to 3-5 related dictionary terms

5. **For lengthy entries**: Extract detailed content into separate Guide articles, keep Dictionary entries concise and scannable
