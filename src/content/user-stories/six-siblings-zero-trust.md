## The situation

Helen and Robert raised six children. Like many parents, they trusted one of their sons — Marcus — to handle things when they were gone.

Both parents named Marcus as executor in their wills. He was also appointed trustee of a family trust set up in 2008. It seemed practical. Marcus was organised, lived nearby, and knew the family finances.

When both parents passed away, Marcus became responsible for two estates and a trust — with five siblings as beneficiaries.

## What went wrong

The problems started with the family home — a coastal property in Dorset.

Marcus moved in.

As executor and trustee, he had access to estate funds. He claimed over £87,000 in occupation costs for living in the property — money that would otherwise have gone to his siblings.

His brothers and sisters saw this as a conflict of interest. How could Marcus act impartially for all beneficiaries while personally benefiting from estate assets?

Communication broke down. Updates stopped. Trust evaporated.

    <h4>Red Flag: Single Executor</h4>
    <p>Naming only one person as executor — without oversight or a backup plan — created the conditions for this conflict. No checks, no balances.</p>
  </div>
</div>

By 2018 — years after their parents' deaths — the siblings had no choice but to take Marcus to court. They wanted him removed as executor and trustee so the estates could finally be administered.

Marcus fought back. He argued he had done nothing wrong, that he was simply fulfilling his duties. The legal battle dragged on for six years.

## The Six-Year Delay

What followed was a slow-motion disaster. Court applications. Legal fees. Mediation sessions that went nowhere. Five siblings, united only by their frustration, against one brother who held all the cards.

## What You Can Learn From This

Helen and Robert thought they were making things simple by putting Marcus in charge. Instead, they created a situation where one person had total control — and no obligation to communicate.

    <h4>Better Approach: Co-Executors or Professional Oversight</h4>
    <p>Name two executors who must act together, or include a professional (solicitor, accountant) to provide accountability.</p>
  </div>
</div>

### Three things this family could have done differently:

**1. Named co-executors.** Two people who must agree on major decisions creates natural accountability.

**2. Required regular reporting.** A clause requiring annual statements to beneficiaries would have surfaced problems early.

**3. Included a removal mechanism.** A clear process for beneficiaries to replace an unresponsive executor — without going to court.
