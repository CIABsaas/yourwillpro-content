## The situation

When Margaret died at 81, her will was straightforward: everything to her two sons, split equally, with the elder son Robert named as executor.

On the surface, the estate seemed simple. A house in Adelaide. A term deposit. Some shares. A small amount of superannuation.

Robert assumed it would take a few months to wrap up. He was wrong.

<div class="pull-quote">
  <p>Robert made a list. Then he made a bigger list.</p>
</div>

## What he found

The first surprise came when Robert started going through his mother's paperwork. There were bank accounts he didn't know about — some dormant, some earning interest. There was a small parcel of land in regional South Australia that hadn't been mentioned in years. And there was a life insurance policy that listed a beneficiary who had died a decade earlier.

Then there were the debts. A personal loan that hadn't been disclosed. An overdue council rates notice. And a murky arrangement with a neighbour involving shared fencing costs that had never been properly resolved.

Robert could have rushed through it. He could have sold the house, split the proceeds, and hoped for the best.

He didn't.

## What he did

Robert made a list. Then he made a bigger list.

He contacted every bank and financial institution he could find in his mother's records. He lodged a search with ASIC to check for shares she might have forgotten. He requested a title search on every property he could link to her name. He wrote to the Australian Taxation Office to confirm whether any returns were outstanding.

He placed the required notices for creditors — not just once, but in the appropriate publications and timeframes. He waited the full period before distributing anything.

When the life insurance company flagged the deceased beneficiary, Robert worked with them to redirect the payout into the estate. When the neighbour disputed the fencing arrangement, Robert found the original agreement in a filing cabinet, confirmed the amounts, and settled it properly.

He kept every receipt. He recorded every phone call. He asked questions when he didn't understand something — and he didn't pretend to know more than he did.

He engaged a solicitor to help with the property transfer and a tax accountant to handle the final returns. He didn't try to do everything himself. But he stayed across everything.

## The outcome

<div class="stat-block">
  <div class="stat-item">
    <div class="stat-number">14</div>
    <div class="stat-label">Months to Complete</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stat-item">
    <div class="stat-number">0</div>
    <div class="stat-label">Disputes</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stat-item">
    <div class="stat-number">100%</div>
    <div class="stat-label">Assets Accounted For</div>
  </div>
</div>

The estate took fourteen months to finalise — longer than Robert expected, but shorter than it might have been.

Every asset was accounted for. Every debt was paid. Every beneficiary received exactly what they were entitled to, with a clear written statement showing how it had been calculated.

There were no surprises after distribution. No creditors emerging. No disputed claims. No sibling fallout.

Robert didn't enjoy the process. But he finished it properly.

## What made the difference

Diligence isn't glamorous. It's not about making bold decisions or resolving dramatic conflicts. It's about doing the boring work — carefully, completely, and in the right order.

Robert understood that an executor's job isn't to rush to the finish line. It's to protect the estate and the people who depend on it. That means checking everything, documenting everything, and resisting the temptation to cut corners even when no one is watching.

He treated the role seriously — not because he was being paid, but because it mattered.

---

## Why this matters

Most executor problems don't come from bad intentions. They come from haste, assumptions, and shortcuts.

An executor who distributes the estate before waiting out the creditor notice period can be personally liable for debts that surface later. An executor who misses a bank account or a property can face accusations of negligence — or worse. An executor who doesn't keep records may find themselves unable to defend decisions they made months earlier.

Diligence is what protects everyone: the executor, the beneficiaries, and the memory of the person who trusted you with this responsibility.

## What good practice looks like

This story is illustrative — a composite based on the kind of careful, methodical work that protects estates from preventable problems.

    <h4>Best Practice: Methodical and Complete</h4>
    <p>Diligence means doing the boring work carefully, completely, and in the right order. Check everything. Document everything. Don't rush.</p>
  </div>
</div>

If you've been named as an executor, here's what diligence looks like in practice:

- **Search thoroughly for assets** — check bank records, ASIC, land registries, and superannuation funds
- **Don't assume the will tells the whole story** — there may be accounts, debts, or arrangements you don't know about
- **Advertise for creditors properly** — and wait the required period before distributing anything
- **Keep records of everything** — receipts, letters, phone call notes, emails
- **Get professional help when you need it** — solicitors, accountants, valuers
- **Don't rush** — it's better to take longer and get it right than to finish fast and face problems later
- **Communicate with beneficiaries** — especially if things are taking longer than expected
