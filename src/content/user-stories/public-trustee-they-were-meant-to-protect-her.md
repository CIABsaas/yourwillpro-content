## The situation

Margaret was in her late 70s when her health declined. She had modest savings, no complex investments, and one adult daughter who helped care for her.

When Margaret lost capacity, her finances were placed under the control of the Queensland Public Trustee. The family was told this was the safest option — neutral, professional, and in Margaret's best interests.

They trusted the system.

## What went wrong

<div class="warning-box">
  <strong>The slow erosion began.</strong> Over the following years, Margaret's estate was steadily consumed — not by fraud, but by process.
</div>

Fees were charged for:

- Routine administration
- Internal legal reviews
- Asset management decisions the family did not request
- Correspondence Margaret herself could not understand

Her daughter repeatedly asked for explanations:

- Why were costs so high?
- Why were decisions taking so long?
- Why was approval needed for everyday expenses?

Responses were slow, generic, or absent.

<div class="callout-box">
  At one point, tens of thousands of dollars had been spent — without any material improvement to Margaret's care or quality of life.
</div>

## The impact on the beneficiary

When Margaret died, her daughter expected to inherit what remained of her mother's savings — money intended to help with housing and security.

Instead, she discovered:

<div class="timeline">
  <div class="timeline-item">
    <div class="timeline-marker"></div>
    <div class="timeline-content">
      <strong>Large portion gone</strong>
      <p>Much of the estate had been consumed by fees</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="timeline-item">
    <div class="timeline-marker"></div>
    <div class="timeline-content">
      <strong>No recourse</strong>
      <p>Decisions could not be easily challenged</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="timeline-item">
    <div class="timeline-marker"></div>
    <div class="timeline-content">
      <strong>No value added</strong>
      <p>Years of administration had achieved little</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

There was no allegation of fraud — but the result was the same: the beneficiary was worse off than if nothing had been done at all.

## Why this happens

<div class="info-box">
  <strong>Public Trustees are:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Highly risk-averse</li>
    <li>Governed by rigid internal policies</li>
    <li>Incentivised to follow process, not personal context</li>
  </ul>
</div>

They do not know the family. They do not interpret nuance. They do not optimise outcomes — they minimise institutional risk.

What is meant to be "neutral" often becomes impersonal and expensive.

## The lesson

Margaret didn't need a government body to manage her affairs.

She needed:

- **Clarity** — about what would happen if she lost capacity
- **Trusted people** — with guidance on how to act
- **Simple safeguards** — not bureaucratic oversight
- **Transparency** — so family could see what was happening

Instead, control was surrendered — and once surrendered, it was extremely hard to reclaim.

<div class="warning-box">
  <strong>Why this matters for people planning today:</strong> Many Australians appoint a Public Trustee because they fear burdening family, believe professionals are safer, or assume government means cheaper. This story shows the hidden cost of that assumption.
</div>

## How this satisfies our criteria

<div class="success-box">
  <strong>YourWillPro helps you avoid this outcome:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Support private executors with education and tools</li>
    <li>Executor &amp; Guardian Kits so people know what to do</li>
    <li>Reduce confusion that leads to Public Trustee defaults</li>
    <li>Secure Will storage with controlled family access</li>
    <li>Keep control with the family — not an institution</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Key takeaway

<div class="callout-box callout-box--large">
  Public Trustees are lawful and well-intentioned — but they are not personal. For many families, the greatest risk is not wrongdoing — it is slow erosion through process, fees, and loss of control.
</div>
