## The situation

When David died at 74, he left behind a life's worth of accumulated assets — and a blended family that didn't always see eye to eye.

There was a house in suburban Brisbane, a rental property on the Sunshine Coast, a self-managed super fund, shares in three companies, and a small business he'd run with a former partner. There were also debts: a line of credit, an outstanding tax bill, and a loan to one of his children that had never been repaired.

His will named his eldest daughter, Sarah, as sole executor. The beneficiaries were his three adult children — two from his first marriage, one from his second.

They didn't hate each other. But they weren't close. And each had their own ideas about what their father had intended.

---

## What went right

Sarah didn't assume anything. She didn't guess. She didn't go quiet.

Within a week of probate being granted, she sent each of her siblings a letter. It explained what being an executor meant, what she was legally required to do, and what they could expect from her. She gave them a timeline — realistic, not optimistic — and told them she'd provide updates every six to eight weeks, or sooner if anything significant happened.

She opened a dedicated estate bank account on day one. Every dollar in and out went through that account — and she kept receipts for everything.

When the Sunshine Coast property needed to be sold, she got two independent valuations before listing it. She sent copies to her siblings and explained why she'd chosen the agent she did. When one of them questioned the sale price, she responded within 48 hours with comparable sales data and an explanation from the agent. No defensiveness. Just information.

When the question of the unpaid loan came up, she didn't take sides. She provided a copy of the loan agreement their father had kept, showed how it appeared in the estate records, and explained how it would be handled under the terms of the will.

She kept a written log of every decision she made — and why.

## The outcome

<div class="stat-block">
  <div class="stat-item">
    <div class="stat-number">11</div>
    <div class="stat-label">Months to Complete</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stat-item">
    <div class="stat-number">0</div>
    <div class="stat-label">Court Applications</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stat-item">
    <div class="stat-number">0</div>
    <div class="stat-label">Family Disputes</div>
  </div>
</div>

The estate was fully distributed in just under eleven months.

There was no court application. No mediation. No lawyers' letters between siblings.

<div class="pull-quote">
  <p>Not because the family was easy — but because no one was ever left in the dark.</p>
</div>

Each beneficiary received a final statement showing what came in, what went out, and how their share was calculated. Sarah didn't ask for executor's commission. She didn't need to justify herself. The paperwork spoke for itself.

## What made the difference

Sarah understood that transparency isn't about being liked. It's about being fair — and being seen to be fair.

She treated her siblings as stakeholders, not obstacles. She answered questions before they became complaints. She documented everything, not because she expected a dispute, but because she knew that good records prevent them.

And when the emotions of grief made things tense, she didn't retreat into silence. She leaned into communication — even when it was uncomfortable.

---

## Why this matters

Most estates don't end up in court. But many of them cause lasting damage to family relationships — not because of what was done, but because of what was never explained.

An executor who keeps beneficiaries informed, responds to questions, and documents their decisions isn't just doing their job. They're protecting the family from the kind of suspicion and resentment that can take years to undo.

Transparency doesn't guarantee harmony. But silence almost always guarantees conflict.

## What good practice looks like

This story is illustrative — a composite based on the practices that experienced estate lawyers recommend. There's no court judgment because there was no dispute. That's the point.

<div class="success-box">

    <path d="M22 11.08V12a10 10 0 1 1-5.93-9.14"/>

  <div>
    <h4>Best Practice: Proactive Communication</h4>
    <p>Keep beneficiaries informed with regular updates, respond promptly to questions, and document every decision. Transparency prevents suspicion and conflict.</p>
  </div>
</div>

If you've been named as an executor, here's what Sarah's approach looked like in practice:

- **Opened a separate estate bank account** — every transaction recorded, nothing mixed with personal funds
- **Sent an initial letter to all beneficiaries** — explaining the process, the likely timeline, and how she'd communicate
- **Provided regular written updates** — even when there wasn't much to report
- **Responded to questions promptly and in writing** — no issue left to fester
- **Obtained independent valuations before selling assets** — and shared them with beneficiaries
- **Documented every decision** — not defensively, but as a matter of course
- **Prepared a final statement of account** — showing every dollar in and out
