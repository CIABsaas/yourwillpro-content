## The situation

When David died unexpectedly, his will was simple. Everything he owned would go to his partner, Sarah, the woman he'd shared his life with for over a decade.

David's brother, Michael, was named executor. It was a common choice — a trusted family member to handle the paperwork and make sure Sarah received what David wanted her to have.

The estate wasn't complicated. There was a modest house, some savings, and personal belongings. In theory, it should have been wrapped up within a year.

But Michael had other ideas.

## What went wrong

From the start, Michael dragged his feet.

Weeks passed. Then months. Sarah asked for updates. She asked for timelines. She asked what was happening with the house, the accounts, the assets David had left her.

Michael didn't respond. Or when he did, his answers were vague. "I'm working on it." "These things take time." "I'll get to it."

But he didn't get to it.

Sarah later discovered that Michael had never accepted David's relationship with her. He'd always believed the estate should go to "real family" — meaning himself and their siblings. The will said otherwise, but Michael seemed determined to make Sarah's life as difficult as possible.

He refused to apply for probate. He refused to transfer assets. He refused to sell the house. He simply refused.

## The impact

Sarah was left in limbo.

She couldn't access David's bank accounts. She couldn't sell or refinance the house they'd shared. She couldn't move on with her life — legally or emotionally.

Every month that passed cost her money. Mortgage payments continued. Bills piled up. And because the estate wasn't finalised, she couldn't access the funds to pay them.

Meanwhile, Michael sat on his hands.

After more than two years of waiting, Sarah had no choice but to hire a lawyer and take Michael to court.

## The outcome

The court was unimpressed.

Michael had no valid reason for the delay. He hadn't encountered any legal obstacles. He hadn't uncovered any problems with the will. He simply didn't want to carry out his duties.

The judge removed Michael as executor and appointed an independent administrator to finalise the estate. Michael was ordered to hand over all documents and cooperate fully.

He was also ordered to pay a portion of Sarah's legal costs — a financial penalty for wasting everyone's time.

The estate was finally settled, but Sarah had lost two years of her life fighting for what David had already given her.

## What could have helped

This situation was entirely avoidable.

**Name an executor who supports your wishes.** If there's any chance a family member might disagree with your will — particularly regarding your partner — don't put them in charge of carrying it out.

**Have a backup executor.** If the first-choice executor can't or won't act, a named substitute can step in without the need for court intervention.

**Talk to your executor before you die.** Make sure they understand what you want and are willing to do it. An executor who disagrees with your wishes is a disaster waiting to happen.

**Consider a professional executor.** For complex family situations, a solicitor or trustee company removes the personal element entirely.

---

## Why this matters

An executor's job is to carry out your wishes — not to substitute their own judgment.

But when an executor disagrees with the will, they can make life miserable for the people you love. Delay is a weapon. Silence is a weapon. And the only remedy is expensive, stressful, time-consuming litigation.

David trusted his brother. That trust was misplaced.

If you're choosing an executor, choose someone who will honour your decisions — not someone who might use your death as an opportunity to rewrite them.
