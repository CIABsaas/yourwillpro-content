## The situation

Maria was a widow in her eighties. She had four children — two sons and two daughters. Like many parents, she wanted to leave her estate to her kids.

But Maria didn't go to a solicitor. She didn't use a professional will-writing service. Instead, she sat down with her two sons at her kitchen table, and together they wrote out her wishes by hand.

The sons helped their mother draft the document. They explained what she needed to include. They watched her sign it.

Then they signed it themselves — as witnesses.

It felt like the right thing to do. They were helping their elderly mother get her affairs in order. They were there to make sure everything was done properly.

They were wrong.

## What went wrong

Under Australian law, a witness to a will cannot be a beneficiary — or the spouse of a beneficiary. If they are, the gift to that person is automatically void.

Maria's sons had witnessed her signature. They were also beneficiaries. That meant any gift to them was invalid.

But it got worse.

Because the sons had helped draft the will, the court also questioned whether Maria had received independent legal advice. Had she really understood what she was signing? Had she been influenced by her sons? Was this truly her own decision?

The daughters challenged the will. They argued it didn't reflect their mother's genuine intentions. They pointed to the witnessing problem. They raised concerns about undue influence.

The case went to court.

## The impact

What should have been a simple family estate turned into a legal nightmare.

The court examined every detail of how the will was created. Who suggested what? Who wrote which words? Who was in the room when Maria signed?

The sons insisted they'd only been helping. The daughters insisted their brothers had steered the outcome in their own favour.

Legal fees mounted. The family split into factions. Relationships that had survived decades were destroyed in months.

And hanging over everything was a question that could never be answered: what did Maria actually want?

## The outcome

The court declared the will invalid.

Because the sons had witnessed the document, their gifts were void under the Succession Act. But the problems with the will went deeper than that. The lack of independent advice, combined with the sons' involvement in drafting, created too much doubt about Maria's true intentions.

The estate was distributed according to intestacy rules — as if Maria had never made a will at all. This meant her assets were divided equally among all four children, regardless of what she may have wanted.

The sons received less than the will would have given them. The daughters received more than they'd expected. And nobody felt like they'd won.

## What could have helped

This disaster was entirely preventable.

**Never let a beneficiary witness your will.** It's a basic rule, but it's the one most often broken. If someone is receiving anything under your will, they cannot sign as a witness.

**Get independent legal advice.** A solicitor isn't just there to write the words. They're there to make sure the will reflects your own wishes, free from influence.

**Don't let beneficiaries help draft the will.** Even if they mean well, their involvement creates suspicion. If you need help, get it from someone who has nothing to gain.

**Use proper witnesses.** Ask neighbours, friends, or colleagues — anyone who isn't a beneficiary or related to one.

## Why this matters

Maria's sons thought they were helping. They weren't trying to cheat their sisters. They weren't trying to manipulate their mother. They just didn't know the rules.

But ignorance isn't a defence. The law is clear, and the consequences are absolute. A witness who benefits from a will doesn't just lose their gift — they can invalidate the entire document.

DIY wills are tempting. They're cheap. They're quick. And they feel like something you can handle yourself.

But one mistake — one wrong signature, one improper witness — can undo everything. Maria spent her final years believing her wishes were recorded. They weren't.

The lesson is simple: if you want your will to work, get professional help.
