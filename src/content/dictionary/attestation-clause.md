    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>**Attestation Clause** (noun) — A declaration at the end of a will stating that the document was signed by the testator in the presence of witnesses who then also signed, confirming the will's proper execution.</p>

    <p>The attestation clause is the formal statement at the end of your will that proves it was signed correctly. It says the will maker signed the document, that witnesses were present, and that everyone understood what was happening.</p>
    <p>This clause matters because it helps prevent challenges to the will later. It creates a record that all the legal requirements were met—the right number of witnesses, everyone was present together, the will maker appeared to understand what they were doing.</p>
    <p>In many places, a properly worded attestation clause makes the will "self-proving," meaning the court can accept it without tracking down the witnesses years later to confirm what happened at the signing.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>You'll find the attestation clause at the very end of a will, just before or after the signature lines. It usually starts with language like "Signed and declared by the testator..." and ends with witnesses confirming their presence and signatures.</p>
  <p>When probating a will, courts look to the attestation clause as evidence the will was properly executed. If it's missing or incorrectly worded, the will might still be valid, but proving it becomes harder. Witnesses might need to give testimony, which is difficult if they've died, moved away, or can't remember the signing.</p>
  <p>Solicitors and will preparation services use standard attestation clause language that complies with local requirements. The exact wording varies by jurisdiction, but the purpose remains the same—creating clear evidence that the will signing followed all legal formalities.</p>
