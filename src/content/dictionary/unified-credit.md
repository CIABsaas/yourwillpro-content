    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>A federal tax credit applied against both estate and gift taxes, effectively exempting a specified amount of transferred wealth from taxation. The unified credit corresponds to the basic exclusion amount (exemption), allowing individuals to transfer significant wealth during life or at death without federal estate or gift tax liability.</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>The unified credit is the amount you can give away during life or leave when you die without paying federal estate or gift taxes. As of recent years, it's in the millions per person, so most estates don't owe federal estate tax.</p>

  <p>"Dad's estate was worth $8 million when he died. The unified credit exempted the first $12.92 million (2023 amount), so his estate owed zero federal estate tax. If he'd given large gifts during life, those would've used up part of the same unified credit."</p>

  <p>The unified credit amount changes frequently with tax law. It was around $5 million in 2011, doubled to over $11 million in 2018, and is scheduled to drop back in 2026 unless Congress acts. Always check current amounts when planning large gifts or estates.</p>
