    <p>A valid will is one that's legally enforceable—it meets all the legal requirements like being properly signed, witnessed, and made by someone mentally competent. If your will isn't valid, it's as if you died without one.</p>

  <p>Requirements for a valid will vary significantly by jurisdiction. Some states allow holographic (handwritten) wills without witnesses, while others require strict formalities.
