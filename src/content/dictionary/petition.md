    <p>A formal request you make to the court asking for something specific. In estate matters, you might petition the court to approve the will, appoint you as executor, authorize property sales, or resolve disputes. It's the official way to ask the court for permission or a decision—you can't just call; you need to file a petition with all required information and follow proper legal process.</p>
