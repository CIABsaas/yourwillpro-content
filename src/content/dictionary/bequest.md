    <p>**Bequest** (noun) — A testamentary gift of property, whether real or personal, made through a will, with the person receiving the gift being the beneficiary or legatee.</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>A bequest is simply a gift you make through your will. It might be a specific item ("my watch to my son"), a sum of money ("$5,000 to my niece"), or a share of what's left ("half my estate to my partner").</p>
    <p>The word sounds formal, but the concept isn't. Every time you say "I leave X to Y" in a will, you're making a bequest.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>Bequests can be specific (a particular item), pecuniary (a fixed sum of money), or residuary (what's left after other gifts and debts are paid). Being clear about what you're leaving and to whom prevents confusion and disputes.</p>
  <p>If the thing you've bequeathed no longer exists when you die—say, you left someone your car but you sold it years ago—that's called ademption, and the gift fails. The person doesn't get equivalent value unless your will specifically says so. This is why keeping your will current matters.</p>
