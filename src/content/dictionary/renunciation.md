    <p>Renunciation is formally saying "no thanks" to an inheritance or a role you've been given. If you're named as executor but don't want the job, you can renounce. If you're left money but want it to go to someone else (like your kids), you can renounce your inheritance.</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>Renunciations have strict time limits—often you must renounce within 9 months of death for tax purposes. If you touch, use, or benefit from the inheritance before renouncing, you've generally accepted it and can no longer disclaim.</p>
