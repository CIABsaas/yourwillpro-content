    <p>**Charitable Trust** (noun) — A trust established with the purpose of benefiting charitable organizations, causes, or the public generally, often receiving favorable tax treatment.</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>A charitable trust is created specifically to benefit charities or charitable purposes. Unlike trusts that benefit your family, a charitable trust is designed to support organizations, causes, or the public good.</p>
    <p>These trusts receive special tax treatment because they serve public benefit. Contributions may be tax-deductible, the trust itself usually doesn't pay income tax, and transfers to charity avoid estate tax. The trade-off is that the benefits must flow to charity, not to you or your family (though some structures, like charitable remainder trusts, provide income to you first).</p>
    <p>Charitable trusts can be simple (leaving money to a named charity) or complex (creating an ongoing foundation to support various causes over time). The key element is charitable purpose—benefiting the community, advancing education, supporting religion, or other recognized charitable aims.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>People create charitable trusts for various reasons: supporting causes they care about, creating a lasting legacy, involving family in philanthropy, or gaining tax advantages while doing good. Wealthy individuals sometimes establish private foundations through charitable trusts.</p>
  <p>These trusts require careful drafting to ensure they qualify for tax benefits and meet legal requirements for charitable purpose. The charity must be legitimate, the purpose must be lawful and recognized as charitable, and the trust must be structured properly.</p>
  <p>You'll encounter charitable trusts in estate planning, particularly for clients with significant assets, strong charitable commitments, or complex tax situations. Many people include charitable gifts in their wills, creating charitable trusts that activate upon death. Others establish living charitable trusts to begin supporting causes immediately.</p>
