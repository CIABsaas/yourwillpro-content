    <p>**Holographic will** (noun) — A will written entirely in the testator's handwriting and signed by them, usually without witnesses. The term comes from the Greek word "holographos," meaning written entirely in one's own hand. Whether such wills are valid depends on the jurisdiction's laws.</p>

    <p>A holographic will is one you write out by hand yourself.</p>
    <p>Unlike a formal will—which is typically typed, signed in front of witnesses, and follows specific legal requirements—a holographic will is handwritten. In some places, that's enough to make it legally valid, even without witnesses. In other places, it's not recognized at all.</p>
    <p>The rules vary significantly. Some jurisdictions accept holographic wills as long as the important parts (the dispositive provisions—the parts that say who gets what) are in your handwriting and you've signed it. Others require the entire document to be handwritten. And some won't accept a holographic will under any circumstances.</p>
    <p>Where holographic wills are recognized, they're often seen as an emergency measure—something you might write if you're suddenly facing death and don't have time to arrange a formal will. But they're risky. Without witnesses and proper formalities, it can be harder to prove the will is genuine or that you were mentally competent when you wrote it.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>If you're thinking about writing a will by hand, it's worth understanding the risks.</p>
  <p>First, check whether your jurisdiction recognizes holographic wills at all. In many places—including England, Wales, and most of Australia—they're not valid. If you write a handwritten will in these jurisdictions, it won't be legally effective no matter how clearly you express your wishes.</p>
  <p>Even where holographic wills are accepted, they're more vulnerable to challenges. Without witnesses, it's harder to prove you wrote it yourself, that you understood what you were doing, and that no one pressured you. Family members who are unhappy with the will's terms may argue it's a forgery or that you lacked capacity.</p>
  <p>Handwritten wills are also more prone to ambiguity. Without professional guidance, you might use unclear language, forget to include important provisions, or accidentally create contradictions that lead to disputes.</p>
  <p>If you're in a situation where you need to make a will urgently and can't access a lawyer, a handwritten will might be better than nothing—but only if you're in a jurisdiction that recognizes them. Otherwise, you're better off using whatever formal will-making options are available, even if they're not perfect.</p>
