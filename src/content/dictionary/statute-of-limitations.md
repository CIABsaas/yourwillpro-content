    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>Laws establishing maximum time periods within which legal proceedings must be commenced, varying by type of claim and jurisdiction. In estate matters, statutes of limitations govern when will contests must be filed, when family provision claims can be brought, when creditors must file claims against estates, and other time-sensitive estate proceedings.</p>

    <p>Statutes of limitations are deadlines for filing lawsuits or claims. If you want to challenge a will or make a family provision claim, you typically have a limited time (often 6 months to a few years, depending on the claim type and jurisdiction). Miss the deadline and you lose your right to sue.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to challenge Dad's will, but I didn't consult a lawyer until 18 months after probate was granted. Unfortunately, the statute of limitations for will contests in our state is 12 months, so my claim was time-barred. I missed the deadline and lost my right to contest."</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>Different estate claims have wildly different time limits. Creditor claims might have 3-6 months, will contests 6-12 months, and family provision claims sometimes up to several years—but it varies dramatically by jurisdiction. Always check your specific deadlines immediately.</p>
