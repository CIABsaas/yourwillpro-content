    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>**Beneficiary Designation** (noun) — A written instruction to a financial institution, superannuation fund, or insurance company specifying the person or entity who should receive benefits or proceeds upon the account holder's death.</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>A beneficiary designation is how you tell a bank, super fund, or insurance company who should get specific assets when you die. Unlike a will, which covers your general estate, these designations apply to particular accounts or policies.</p>
    <p>Think of it as a direct instruction: "This account goes to this person." It's simple but powerful—and it usually overrides what your will says about those assets.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>Common examples include superannuation death benefit nominations, life insurance policies, and some bank accounts. These designations sit outside your will and often pass directly to the named person without going through probate.</p>
  <p>The catch is keeping them up to date. A beneficiary designation you made years ago might not reflect your current wishes. If you've married, divorced, had children, or experienced other life changes, check these designations. They're binding, even if they contradict your will or your current family situation.</p>

<div class="example-box">
  <div class="example-label">EXAMPLE</div>
  <p>"I updated my super fund's beneficiary designation to name my new wife instead of my ex, so there's no confusion about who should receive my death benefit."</p>
</div>

<div class="why-matters">
  <h3>💡 Why this matters</h3>
  <p>Beneficiary designations override your will. If your super nomination says your ex-spouse gets everything, that's what happens—even if your will says otherwise and you've remarried. Outdated nominations are one of the most common estate planning mistakes, leading to unintended inheritances and family disputes.</p>
  <p>Checking and updating these designations should be part of every major life change.</p>

<div class="common-mistakes">
  <h3>⚠️ Common mistakes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Making a new will but forgetting to update beneficiary nominations on super and insurance</li>
    <li>Assuming your will controls all your assets—some pass via beneficiary designation instead</li>
    <li>Not updating nominations after divorce, marriage, or having children</li>
    <li>Not understanding the difference between binding and non-binding nominations—they have very different legal effects</li>
  </ul>
