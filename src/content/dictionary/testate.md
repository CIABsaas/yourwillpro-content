    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>The condition of dying with a legally valid will that disposes of at least some of the decedent's property. A person who dies testate has executed a will meeting statutory requirements, providing for distribution of their estate according to their expressed wishes rather than intestacy laws.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column-card plain-column">
    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>Testate means you die with a valid will. If you die testate, your property goes to the people named in your will, not according to the default rules for people who die without a will (intestate).</p>
