    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>To confer an immediate, fixed right to present or future property ownership that cannot be taken away, even though actual possession or enjoyment may be postponed. Once an interest vests, the holder has a legally protected right to the property, though conditions may delay when they receive it.</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>When property rights "vest," you get a guaranteed right to it even if you can't have it yet. Like a trust saying you get the money at age 25—your right vests immediately, but possession vests (you actually get it) at 25.</p>

  <p>"Dad's trust gives me the house when I turn 30. My interest vested when Dad died—I have a guaranteed right to it. But possession doesn't vest until I'm 30. If I die before 30, my estate gets it because my vested interest passes to my heirs."</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>You can have a vested interest in property you can't touch for years. If a trust says you get $100,000 at age 40 with no other conditions, your interest is vested now—you have a guaranteed right to it. But if it says you get it "if you graduate college," that's contingent, not vested.</p>
