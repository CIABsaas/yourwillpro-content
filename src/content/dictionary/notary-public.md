    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>A person officially authorized by government to witness document signings, verify identity, administer oaths, and certify copies. Role and powers vary significantly: in common law countries, notaries handle specialized/international documents. In the US, widely used for routine witnessing. In civil law jurisdictions, highly trained legal professionals.</p>

    <p>Someone officially authorized to witness you signing documents and verify your identity. In the US, notaries are common and inexpensive, used for powers of attorney and many documents. In Australia and UK, notaries are less common—mainly for international documents or specialized transactions. Most wills don't need notarization in common law countries—ordinary witnesses suffice. Notarization confirms who signed, not whether the document is legally valid.</p>

  <p>"I needed to send a certified copy of my birth certificate overseas, so I had a notary public certify it as a true copy of the original. They checked the documents, added their seal, and charged $50."</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>In Australia and the UK, wills don't need to be notarized—they just need two witnesses. Notarization adds nothing to a will's validity in these jurisdictions. In the US, many states allow optional self-proving affidavits (which ARE notarized) that can streamline probate, but the will itself doesn't require notarization.</p>
