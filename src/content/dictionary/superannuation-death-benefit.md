    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>The amount payable from a superannuation fund upon a member's death, distributed according to binding death benefit nominations, non-binding nominations, or trustee discretion as governed by superannuation law and the fund's trust deed. Death benefits can be paid as lump sums or pensions to eligible beneficiaries, subject to specific tax treatment.</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>Your superannuation death benefit is the money in your super fund that gets paid out when you die. Who receives it depends on whether you've made a valid binding death benefit nomination, otherwise the super fund trustee decides. It doesn't automatically go through your will—super is separate.</p>

<div class="example-box">
  <div class="example-label">EXAMPLE</div>
  <p>"Dad had $400,000 in super with a binding death benefit nomination to Mum. When he died, the super fund paid that money directly to Mum as a tax-free lump sum—it didn't go through his will or estate. We didn't even need probate to access the super."</p>

  <h3>⚖️ Compare: Binding vs Non-Binding Nomination</h3>
  <div class="compare-grid">
    <div class="compare-item">
      <div class="compare-term">Binding Nomination</div>
      <p>Legally binding on fund. Must pay to nominated beneficiaries. Expires after 3 years (usually). Certainty for beneficiaries.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="compare-item">
      <div class="compare-term">Non-Binding Nomination</div>
      <p>Guide only. Trustee has discretion. Never expires. Less certain outcome.</p>
    </div>

<div class="why-matters">
  <h3>💡 Why this matters</h3>
  <p>For many Australians, superannuation is their largest asset after their home—often hundreds of thousands of dollars. Yet it doesn't automatically go through your will. Without a valid binding death benefit nomination, the super fund trustee decides who gets your super, which might not match your wishes or will.</p>
  <p>This can cause family conflict and unintended outcomes, especially in blended families or estranged relationships.</p>
</div>

<div class="common-mistakes">
  <h3>⚠️ Common mistakes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Assuming super automatically goes to your spouse or follows your will—it doesn't</li>
    <li>Making a binding nomination then forgetting it expires after 3 years (in most funds)</li>
    <li>Not updating nominations after divorce, remarriage, or having children</li>
    <li>Not coordinating super nominations with your will, creating conflicting instructions</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="did-you-know">
  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>Superannuation death benefits can be tax-free or taxable depending on who receives them and how. Payments to a spouse or financial dependant are usually tax-free, but payments to adult children as lump sums may attract tax on the taxable component.</p>
