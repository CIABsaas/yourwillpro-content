    <p>**Court** (noun) — A governmental institution with authority to adjudicate legal disputes, interpret laws, and administer justice through formal proceedings.</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>A court is where legal disputes get resolved. It's the formal setting where judges hear evidence, interpret law, and make binding decisions on legal questions.</p>
    <p>Different courts handle different matters. Probate courts deal with wills and estates, family courts handle divorce and custody, and so on. The court system is hierarchical—lower courts make initial decisions, higher courts hear appeals.</p>
    <p>Going to court isn't always adversarial. Some court proceedings are administrative (like probating an uncontested will) rather than disputes. The court's role is verifying the process was followed correctly and making things official.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>In estate administration, courts supervise probate proceedings, resolve will contests, approve executor actions, and settle disputes between beneficiaries. Even uncontested estates typically require some court involvement to officially transfer assets.</p>
  <p>Court processes are formal and public. Documents filed with courts become public records (with limited exceptions). Proceedings follow specific rules. Deadlines matter. Failing to respond appropriately to court requirements can result in default judgments or other negative consequences.</p>
  <p>You'll interact with courts when probating estates, contesting wills, seeking guardianships or conservatorships, or resolving trust disputes. Understanding which court has jurisdiction, what that court's procedures require, and when court involvement is necessary are essential aspects of estate administration. Many people use lawyers for court matters because the procedures are complex and mistakes have significant consequences.</p>
