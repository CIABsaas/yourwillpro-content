    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>The portion of a decedent's estate remaining after all specific devises and bequests, debts, taxes, and administration expenses have been satisfied. The residuary estate includes all property not specifically disposed of in the will and passes to the residuary beneficiaries according to the residuary clause.</p>
  </div>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>The residuary estate is what's left after everything else has been given away or paid. If someone's will says "I give my car to my son, $10,000 to charity, and the rest to my daughter," the "rest" is the residuary estate—everything remaining after the car, the $10,000, and all bills are paid.</p>

  <p>"Dad's estate was worth $500,000 total. After specific gifts of $50,000 and debts and expenses of $100,000, the residuary estate was $350,000. That was split among us three kids as residuary beneficiaries, so we each received about $117,000."</p>

<div class="why-matters">
  <h3>💡 Why this matters</h3>
  <p>The residuary clause is often the most important part of a will because it catches everything not specifically mentioned—new assets acquired before death, forgotten accounts, or assets that no longer exist as specified. Without a residuary clause, these assets pass by intestacy, potentially going to people you didn't intend.</p>
  <p>Always include a residuary clause in your will, even if you think you've covered everything specifically.</p>
</div>

<div class="common-mistakes">
  <h3>⚠️ Common mistakes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Not including a residuary clause, leaving "leftover" assets to pass by intestacy</li>
    <li>Assuming the residuary estate will be large when debts and expenses might consume most of it</li>
    <li>Making specific bequests that total more than the estate value, leaving nothing for residuary beneficiaries</li>
    <li>Not updating the residuary clause after major life changes or asset changes</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="did-you-know">
  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>If debts and expenses exceed the value of specific bequests and available assets, the residuary estate can be completely depleted—leaving residuary beneficiaries with nothing, even though they were meant to receive "everything else."</p>
