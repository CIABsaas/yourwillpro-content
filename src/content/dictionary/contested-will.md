<div class="why-matters">
  <h3>💡 Why this matters</h3>
  <p>Contesting a will is expensive — legal fees often exceed $50,000 and cases can drag on for years. Even successful challenges can destroy family relationships permanently.</p>
  <p>Understanding the grounds for contesting helps you either strengthen your own will against challenges, or realistically assess whether a challenge is worth pursuing.</p>
</div>

<div class="common-mistakes">
  <h3>⚠️ Common mistakes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Assuming you can contest simply because you're unhappy with what you received</li>
    <li>Waiting too long — strict time limits apply (often 6-12 months from probate)</li>
    <li>Underestimating the cost and emotional toll of litigation</li>
    <li>Not getting legal advice before starting — many claims have no legal basis</li>
  </ul>
