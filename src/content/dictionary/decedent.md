    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>Decedent is the formal legal term for the person who died. It's used throughout estate administration documents, court filings, and probate proceedings instead of saying "the deceased" or using the person's name repeatedly.</p>
    <p>You'll see this term constantly in legal paperwork. "The decedent's estate," "assets owned by the decedent," "debts owed by the decedent." It's simply the legal way of referring to the person whose estate is being settled.</p>
    <p>Different jurisdictions use different terms. Some say "deceased," others say "decedent," and some use "testator" if the person left a will. They all mean the same thing—the person who died.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>The term appears in every probate document. Court forms ask about "the decedent's assets," executors file "inventories of the decedent's property," and beneficiaries claim "distributions from the decedent's estate."</p>
  <p>Using "decedent" instead of the person's name serves a practical purpose in legal documents. It keeps the language consistent and formal, particularly in templates and standard forms that apply to anyone's estate.</p>
  <p>You'll encounter this term when reading wills, probate court documents, estate tax forms, and communications from executors or estate lawyers. It's not meant to be impersonal or disrespectful—it's simply the standard legal terminology for estate administration.</p>
