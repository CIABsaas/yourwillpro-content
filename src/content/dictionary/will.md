    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>A legally executed document by which a person (the testator) makes disposition of their property to take effect upon death. A valid will must meet statutory requirements including testamentary capacity, testamentary intent, and proper execution formalities such as signature and witnesses. The will is revocable during the testator's lifetime.</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>A will is your written instructions for who gets your property when you die. It names beneficiaries, appoints an executor to handle your estate, and can designate guardians for minor children. Without a valid will, state law decides who inherits.</p>

  <div class="example-label">EXAMPLE</div>
  <p>"Mum's will left her house to my brother, her savings to my sister, and her personal belongings to me. She named my uncle as executor to handle the estate. Because she had a valid will, her wishes controlled—not the state's default inheritance laws."</p>

<div class="why-matters">
  <h3>💡 Why this matters</h3>
  <p>Without a valid will, you lose control over who inherits your assets, who raises your children, and who manages your estate. The law decides everything using a one-size-fits-all formula that rarely matches anyone's actual wishes. This can cause family conflict, unintended outcomes, and lengthy court processes.</p>
  <p>A will is the foundation of estate planning—without it, everything else is harder and more expensive.</p>
</div>

<div class="common-mistakes">
  <h3>⚠️ Common mistakes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Writing wishes on paper without proper signing and witnesses—this creates an invalid will</li>
    <li>Assuming a will from another state or country is automatically valid in your jurisdiction</li>
    <li>Failing to update your will after major life events like marriage, divorce, or having children</li>
    <li>Not storing the original will safely or telling anyone where to find it</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="did-you-know">
  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>Despite what you see in movies, will readings are largely ceremonial and not required by law. Beneficiaries are typically notified by mail, and anyone interested can request a copy once the will is filed with the probate court, where it becomes a public record.</p>
