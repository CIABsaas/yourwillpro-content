    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>**Guardianship** (noun) — A legal relationship created by court order or law whereby one person (the guardian) is granted authority and responsibility to make personal and welfare decisions for another person (the ward) who is unable to care for themselves, typically a minor child or incapacitated adult.</p>

    <p>Guardianship is the legal arrangement where someone takes responsibility for caring for another person who can't care for themselves. When you have guardianship of someone, you make decisions about their daily life, health care, education, and general welfare.</p>
    <p>Most commonly, guardianship involves children. Parents have automatic guardianship of their own children until the children turn eighteen. But if parents die or can't care for their children, someone else needs to become guardian. You can nominate a guardian for your children in your will, though a court must approve the appointment.</p>
    <p>Guardianship also applies to adults who can't manage their own affairs due to mental or physical incapacity. Unlike power of attorney, which someone grants voluntarily while they have capacity, guardianship is imposed by a court when someone is already unable to make their own decisions.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>When you make a will and have minor children, appointing a guardian is crucial. If something happens to you, the person you've named can apply to become the children's legal guardian. The court will usually respect your choice unless there are serious concerns about the person's suitability.</p>
  <p>The guardian you appoint in your will handles the children's personal welfare and upbringing. This is separate from who manages any money you leave for the children—that's typically handled by a trustee. Sometimes the same person serves both roles, but they're legally distinct responsibilities.</p>
  <p>For adults, guardianship typically requires a court hearing where evidence is presented about the person's incapacity. The court appoints a guardian only if convinced the person truly can't make their own decisions and no less restrictive alternative exists. This is why documents like enduring powers of attorney are so important—they let you choose who manages your affairs before incapacity strikes, avoiding the need for court-imposed guardianship.</p>

<div class="why-matters">
  <h3>💡 Why this matters</h3>
  <p>If you die without appointing a guardian for your minor children, the court decides who raises them. This might not be who you would have chosen. Family disputes can arise, causing stress for children during an already traumatic time. Appointing a guardian in your will prevents this uncertainty.</p>
  <p>For adults requiring guardianship, the court process is expensive and intrusive. Having an enduring power of attorney and advance care directive in place avoids this.</p>
