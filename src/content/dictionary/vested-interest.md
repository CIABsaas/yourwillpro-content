    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>An immediate, fixed right to present or future enjoyment of property that is not subject to a condition precedent (other than the passage of time). The holder of a vested interest has a legally protected right that cannot be defeated, though actual possession or enjoyment may be postponed to a future time.</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>A vested interest is a guaranteed right to property, even if you can't have it yet. Once your interest is vested, nobody can take it away—though you might have to wait to actually receive it.</p>

  <div class="example-label">EXAMPLE</div>
  <p>"Grandma's trust gives each grandchild $50,000 at age 25, with no other conditions. My 10-year-old daughter has a vested interest now—it's guaranteed hers. If she dies before 25, her estate gets it. Compare that to 'if she graduates college'—that would be contingent, not vested."</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>The distinction between vested and contingent interests matters enormously if a beneficiary dies before receiving property. A vested interest passes to their estate or heirs; a contingent interest often disappears. That's why "to my children who reach age 25" creates contingent interests, while "to my children, to be distributed at 25" creates vested interests.</p>
