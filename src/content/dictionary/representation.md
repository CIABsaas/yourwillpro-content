    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>A doctrine of inheritance law whereby descendants of a deceased heir stand in that heir's place and take the share their ancestor would have received. Also called "per stirpes" distribution—if a child predeceases the testator, that child's children (the grandchildren) take by representation, splitting their parent's share.</p>

  <div class="column-card plain-column">
    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>Representation means grandchildren can step into their deceased parent's shoes and inherit what their parent would have gotten. If your dad dies before your grandma, you can "represent" your dad and receive his share of grandma's estate, split with your siblings.</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>The principle of representation has been recognized in law for centuries to prevent families from being disinherited just because the middle generation died young. Without it, grandchildren would get nothing if their parent died before the grandparent.</p>
