    <p>**Heir apparent** (noun) — A person whose right to inherit property or a title cannot be defeated or displaced by the birth of another heir, provided they survive the person from whom they stand to inherit. The term contrasts with "heir presumptive," whose position could be displaced by someone with a stronger claim to inheritance.</p>

    <p>An heir apparent is someone who is certain to inherit—as long as they outlive the person they're inheriting from. Their position as the future inheritor can't be changed by someone else being born or coming forward with a better claim.</p>
    <p>This term comes from inheritance of titles and property in aristocratic families, where the eldest son was typically the heir apparent to his father's estate and title. Nothing could change that position except the heir dying before his father.</p>
    <p>In modern estate planning, the term is rarely used in formal documents. You don't need to identify someone as your "heir apparent" in your will. Instead, you simply name your beneficiaries—the people who will receive your property when you die.</p>
    <p>However, the concept still matters when you're thinking about who will inherit if you die without a will. In that situation, the law determines who your heirs are based on your family relationships. Your children, if you have them, are typically your heirs apparent—they're first in line to inherit under the law.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>When you're making your will, you don't need to worry about technical terms like heir apparent. You simply decide who gets what and write it down clearly.</p>
  <p>But understanding the concept can help you think through your plans. If you have children, they would be your natural heirs if you died without a will. By making a will, you're taking control of that process and deciding for yourself how your property should be distributed.</p>
  <p>The term also highlights an important estate planning principle: your plans need to account for the possibility that someone might die before you. That's why well-drafted wills include backup beneficiaries. If your intended beneficiary dies before you do, the gift goes to someone else you've named, rather than falling into your residuary estate or being distributed according to the intestacy laws.</p>
