    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>A devise is what you call it when someone leaves real estate to you in their will. If your grandmother's will says "I devise my house to my granddaughter," that means she's giving you the house.</p>
    <p>The word is specifically used for property like land, houses, or buildings. If someone leaves you money, jewelry, or other possessions in their will, that's called a bequest or legacy—not a devise.</p>
    <p>You might also see this word used as a verb: "She devised her farm to her nephew" means she left her farm to him in her will.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>In older legal documents and formal wills, you'll often see the term "devise" used to distinguish real property from personal property. This distinction matters in some jurisdictions because historically, different rules applied to how land and personal possessions could be transferred after death.</p>
  <p>For example, a will might say: "I devise my property at 42 Oak Street to my son, and I bequeath my jewelry to my daughter." The house is devised; the jewelry is bequeathed.</p>
  <p>The person who receives a devise is called a devisee. So if your aunt devises her cottage to you, you're the devisee of that property.</p>
