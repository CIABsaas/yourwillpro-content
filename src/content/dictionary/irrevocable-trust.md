    <p>**Irrevocable trust** (noun) — A trust that, once established and funded, cannot be amended, modified, or revoked by the settlor (the person who created it). Once assets are transferred into an irrevocable trust, the settlor permanently relinquishes ownership and control over those assets. This contrasts with a revocable trust, which the settlor can alter or terminate at will.</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>An irrevocable trust is a trust you can't change your mind about.</p>
    <p>Once you set it up and transfer assets into it, those assets are no longer yours. You can't take them back. You can't change who the beneficiaries are. You can't dissolve the trust and pretend it never happened. The arrangement is permanent—locked in place unless all the beneficiaries agree to change it, or unless a court orders a change in exceptional circumstances.</p>
    <p>This permanence is the defining feature—and it creates both the benefits and the drawbacks of irrevocable trusts.</p>
    <p>The main advantage is that by giving up ownership and control, you also give up legal responsibility for the assets. They're no longer counted as yours for purposes of creditor claims, means-tested benefits, or certain taxes. In some jurisdictions, assets in an irrevocable trust can be protected from aged care fees, Medicaid recovery, or estate taxes.</p>
    <p>The main disadvantage is obvious: you lose control. If your circumstances change, if you need the money, if you regret your decision—too bad. The trust owns the assets now, and the trustee manages them according to the trust terms, not according to your current wishes.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>Irrevocable trusts are powerful but inflexible tools. They're not for everyone, and they're rarely the right choice for people who might need access to their assets.</p>
  <p>Common uses include asset protection (shielding assets from creditors or protecting eligibility for government benefits), tax planning (reducing estate tax liability by removing assets from your estate), and providing for beneficiaries with special needs or poor judgment (ensuring they're supported without giving them direct control over money).</p>
  <p>Some trusts are irrevocable by choice—you deliberately create them to achieve specific goals like asset protection or tax benefits. Others are irrevocable by nature—testamentary trusts created by your will are always irrevocable because you're not around to change them.</p>
  <p>Before creating an irrevocable trust, you need to understand exactly what you're giving up. You won't be able to:
- Take the assets back if you need them
- Change the beneficiaries if your relationships or intentions change
- Modify the trust terms if they turn out to be impractical or unworkable
- Act as trustee and manage the assets yourself (in most structures)</p>
  <p>There are some limited circumstances where an irrevocable trust can be modified or terminated—if all beneficiaries agree, if the trust purpose has become impossible or illegal, or if a court finds the trust should be reformed. But these are exceptions. The default expectation is that an irrevocable trust is truly irrevocable.</p>
  <p>If you're considering an irrevocable trust, get proper legal and tax advice. The consequences of getting it wrong—or discovering you needed the assets after all—can be severe. For most people, simpler estate planning tools provide enough flexibility and control without requiring such a permanent commitment.</p>
