    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>The intentional and voluntary abandonment or relinquishment of a known legal right, claim, or privilege. A waiver may be express (stated explicitly) or implied (inferred from conduct), and once made, generally prevents the waiving party from later asserting the relinquished right.</p>

    <p>A waiver is when you voluntarily give up a right you have. In estate law, common waivers include giving up your right to contest a will, your spousal elective share, or your right to an accounting from an executor.</p>

<div class="did-you-know">
  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>Waivers must generally be knowing and voluntary to be effective. If you waived your rights without understanding what you were giving up or under pressure, a court might find the waiver invalid. That's why prenuptial agreements waiving estate rights often require both parties to have independent legal advice.</p>
