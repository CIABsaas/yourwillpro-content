    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>**Distribution** (noun) — The process of dividing and transferring assets from a deceased person's estate to the beneficiaries or heirs entitled to receive them, either according to the terms of a will or under intestacy laws.</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>Distribution is the act of actually giving out the estate to the people who are supposed to receive it. This is what happens after all the debts are paid, taxes are sorted, and everything is ready to be handed over to the beneficiaries.</p>
    <p>If there's a will, the executor distributes the assets according to what it says. If there's no will, the administrator distributes everything according to the law's formula for who gets what.</p>
    <p>Distribution doesn't happen immediately after someone dies. First, the executor needs to gather all the assets, pay all the debts and taxes, and get court approval if required. Only then can they distribute what's left to the beneficiaries.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>Distribution is often the final stage of estate administration, but it can take months or even years to reach this point. The executor can't just hand out assets as soon as someone dies—they need to make sure they've identified everything the deceased owned, paid all legitimate debts, and followed proper legal procedures.</p>
  <p>For example, if your aunt leaves you her house in her will, you don't get the keys the day after the funeral. The executor needs to value the estate, pay any outstanding debts, file tax returns, and get probate if necessary. Once all that's done, they can distribute the house to you by transferring the title into your name.</p>
  <p>Executors can be held personally liable if they distribute assets incorrectly or too early. If they give out everything and then discover an unpaid debt, they might have to pay it out of their own pocket. That's why distribution is usually one of the last things an executor does.</p>
