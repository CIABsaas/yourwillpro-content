    <p>The age of majority is when you're legally considered an adult. In Australia, that's 18. Before this age, you're a minor, and your parents or guardians make most legal decisions for you.</p>
    <p>Once you reach 18, you can vote, make a legally binding will, enter into contracts, and generally exercise full legal rights.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>In wills, the age of majority matters because you must be at least 18 to make a valid will (with limited exceptions for married persons or those on active military service). Many wills also specify that beneficiaries must reach the age of majority—or sometimes an older age like 21 or 25—before receiving their inheritance.</p>
  <p>If you die leaving minor children, they can't inherit directly. Instead, the inheritance is usually held in trust for them until they reach the specified age. This protects young people from receiving large sums before they're equipped to manage them.</p>
