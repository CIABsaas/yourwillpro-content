    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>A general term encompassing anyone legally authorized to administer a deceased person's estate, including both executors (appointed by a valid will) and administrators (appointed by the court when there's no will or no executor able to act). Authority derives either from the will or from the court's grant of letters of administration. Duties and powers are substantially similar regardless of how appointed.</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>The person who handles someone's affairs after they die. An umbrella term that includes both executors (if there's a will) and administrators (if there isn't). Instead of remembering whether to call someone an executor or administrator, "personal representative" covers both. They're responsible for collecting assets, paying debts, and distributing what's left to beneficiaries.</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>"Personal representative" is increasingly used as the standard term because it's neutral and inclusive—it doesn't matter whether you were named in a will (executor) or appointed by the court (administrator). You have the same basic responsibilities either way: gather assets, pay debts, file taxes, and distribute what remains to the rightful beneficiaries.</p>
