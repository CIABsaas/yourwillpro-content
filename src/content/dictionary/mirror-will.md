    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>Wills made by two people (typically spouses or partners) with matching provisions, each leaving everything to the other and then to the same ultimate beneficiaries. Unlike mutual wills, mirror wills are not binding—each person can change or revoke their will at any time.</p>
  </div>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>Wills made by a couple that say the same thing: "Everything to my spouse. If my spouse has died, everything to our children." Both wills follow this pattern, creating a mirror image. The key point: they're not binding. Either person can change their will anytime—unlike mutual wills, there's no agreement preventing changes. Most common type of will for married couples.</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>The survivor can change their will after the first spouse dies. This flexibility is the key difference from mutual wills—if you want to bind the survivor to the original plan, you need a testamentary trust or (rarely) mutual wills instead.</p>
