    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>An expedited probate procedure available for estates meeting certain criteria—typically small value, simple asset structure, or all beneficiaries in agreement. Summary administration reduces formalities, court appearances, and time compared to formal probate, while still providing legal authority for asset distribution.</p>
