    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>**Guardian ad Litem** (noun) — A person appointed by a court to represent and protect the interests of a minor child or legally incapacitated adult during specific legal proceedings, with authority limited to that particular case or matter.</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>A guardian ad litem is someone the court appoints to look after a child's or incapacitated person's interests during a legal case. The Latin phrase "ad litem" means "for the lawsuit"—this guardian's role is specifically for that court case, not for general ongoing care.</p>
    <p>Unlike a regular guardian who has broad ongoing authority over a child or adult's affairs, a guardian ad litem has limited authority focused on one case. They investigate the situation, gather information, and make recommendations to the court about what's in the person's best interests. Once the case is resolved, their role ends.</p>
    <p>In estate matters, a guardian ad litem might be appointed when a will or estate dispute affects a minor or someone who can't represent themselves. The guardian ensures their interests are protected in court, even if they can't speak for themselves or don't have anyone else advocating for them.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>Courts appoint guardians ad litem when someone involved in a case can't adequately represent their own interests. This happens most commonly with children in custody disputes, but also occurs in estate litigation when beneficiaries are minors or lack mental capacity.</p>
  <p>For example, if a will is being challenged and one of the beneficiaries is a five-year-old child, the court might appoint a guardian ad litem to represent that child's interests during the dispute. The guardian investigates, reviews evidence, and advises the court whether any proposed settlement or outcome serves the child's best interests.</p>
  <p>The guardian ad litem operates independently. They're not representing the parents, other family members, or anyone else—only the person they've been appointed to protect. They report directly to the court and can recommend outcomes that might differ from what parents or other parties want. This independence is crucial to ensuring vulnerable parties' interests aren't overlooked in complex legal proceedings.</p>
