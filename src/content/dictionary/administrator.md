<div class="why-matters">
  <h3>💡 Why this matters</h3>
  <p>If someone dies without a will, their estate can't be accessed until the court appoints an administrator. This process takes time — often 4 to 8 weeks — during which bank accounts are frozen and property can't be sold.</p>
  <p>Knowing who can apply, and the priority order, helps families act quickly and avoid costly delays.</p>
</div>

<div class="common-mistakes">
  <h3>⚠️ Common mistakes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Assuming a spouse or child can automatically access accounts without court approval</li>
    <li>Not applying for Letters of Administration before trying to deal with banks or property</li>
    <li>Waiting too long to apply — delays can freeze assets for months</li>
    <li>Confusing administrator with executor — they have the same duties but different authority sources</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="did-you-know">
  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>In most jurisdictions, the court follows a priority order when appointing an administrator—typically the surviving spouse first, then children, then parents, then siblings.</p>
