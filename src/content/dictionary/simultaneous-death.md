    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>A situation where two or more persons die in the same event or in circumstances making it impossible or impractical to determine who died first. Most jurisdictions have enacted simultaneous death statutes providing that when order of death cannot be determined, each person is deemed to have predeceased the other for purposes of inheritance and property distribution.</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>Simultaneous death is when two people die at the same time (like in a car accident or plane crash) and you can't tell who died first. The law treats each person as if they died before the other for inheritance purposes, preventing property from passing through both estates unnecessarily.</p>

  <div class="example-label">EXAMPLE</div>
  <p>"A couple died in a car crash, and medical evidence couldn't establish who died first. Under simultaneous death laws, the husband's estate was distributed as if his wife had predeceased him, and her estate was distributed as if he had predeceased her—meaning each estate went to their respective families rather than through each other."</p>

      <p>Voluntary provision in will. Requires beneficiary survive by specified period (e.g., 30 days). Planned protection against common disasters.</p>

<div class="did-you-know">
  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>Most well-drafted wills include a survivorship clause requiring beneficiaries to survive the testator by 30 days or so, which effectively overrides simultaneous death statutes and prevents assets from passing briefly to a deceased spouse and then immediately to their estate.</p>
