    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>The mental state or animus testandi required for a valid will, demonstrating that the testator intended the document to serve as their will—their final statement on how property should be distributed at death. The testator must intend the specific document to have legal effect upon their death.</p>
  </div>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>Testamentary intent means you actually meant for the document to be your will when you signed it. You weren't just writing notes, making a draft, or signing under duress—you genuinely intended this to be your final wishes about who gets your stuff when you die.</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>Testamentary intent can be undermined by fraud, undue influence, or duress. Even if someone signs a properly formatted will, if they were forced to do so or tricked about its contents, they lacked true testamentary intent and the will can be invalidated.</p>
