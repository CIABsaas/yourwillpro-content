    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>An <strong>executor</strong> is a person or institution nominated in a will to carry out the terms of the will and administer the deceased's estate, including collecting assets, paying debts, and distributing property to beneficiaries.</p>
    <p>The executor derives their authority from the will itself and, upon being granted probate, becomes the legal representative of the deceased's estate.</p>
  </div>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>An executor is the person you choose to handle your affairs after you die. Think of them as the project manager of your estate.</p>
    <p>They gather everything you owned, pay what you owed, and give what's left to the people you wanted to have it — all according to your will.</p>
    <p>It's a big responsibility that requires trust, organization, and often takes 6-18 months to complete.</p>

<div class="why-matters">
  <h3>💡 Why this matters</h3>
  <p>Executors handle everything from funeral arrangements to final tax returns. Choosing the wrong person—or not choosing anyone—can delay estate settlement by months or even years, causing stress for grieving families and potentially costly legal disputes.</p>
  <p>A good executor can make a difficult time easier. A poor choice or no choice at all can turn grief into chaos.</p>
</div>

<div class="common-mistakes">
  <h3>⚠️ Common mistakes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Choosing someone who lives far away or overseas without considering the practical difficulties</li>
    <li>Naming only one executor without a backup, risking delays if they can't serve</li>
    <li>Not asking the person first if they're willing to take on the responsibility</li>
    <li>Assuming a family member is automatically the best choice, even if they're disorganized or in poor health</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="did-you-know">
  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>Executors can be held personally liable for mistakes they make while administering an estate. This is why many executors work with solicitors, especially for complex estates. They can also be removed by the court if they're not doing their job properly or if there's a conflict of interest.</p>
