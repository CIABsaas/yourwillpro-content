    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>Property that passes directly to designated beneficiaries or joint owners upon death without going through probate. Common examples include jointly-owned property with right of survivorship, life insurance with named beneficiaries, retirement accounts, and assets held in living trusts. Not controlled by the will.</p>

  <div class="column-card plain-column">
    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>Assets that automatically go to someone when you die, without going through probate or your will. Common examples: jointly-owned homes (go to surviving owner), life insurance (goes to named beneficiary), superannuation/retirement accounts with beneficiary designations, bank accounts with payable-on-death beneficiaries. These bypass your executor and transfer directly. Your will doesn't control them—their own beneficiary designations or ownership structure does.</p>

  <div class="example-label">EXAMPLE</div>
  <p>"When Dad died, his house went straight to Mum because they owned it as joint tenants—it was a non-probate asset. But his car was in his name only, so it went through probate as part of his estate."</p>

<div class="did-you-know">
  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>Many people are surprised to learn that their will doesn't control non-probate assets. If your life insurance names your ex-spouse, or your superannuation has an outdated beneficiary, those assets go to the named person—not who you specified in your will. Always review and update your beneficiary designations.</p>
