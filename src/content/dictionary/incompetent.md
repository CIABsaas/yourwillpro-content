    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>**Incompetent** (adjective) — An outdated legal term formerly used to describe a person who has been formally determined by a court to lack the mental capacity to manage their own affairs, make legal decisions, or care for themselves. Modern legal terminology has largely replaced this term with "lacks capacity" or "incapacitated person" to reflect a more respectful and functional approach to assessing decision-making ability.</p>

    <p>"Incompetent" is an old legal term that meant someone couldn't make decisions for themselves or manage their own affairs. It's fallen out of use because it's both stigmatizing and imprecise.</p>
    <p>The problem with the term is that it treats capacity as all-or-nothing: you're either competent or incompetent, capable or incapable. But that's not how capacity actually works. Someone might be able to make simple decisions about their daily routine but unable to manage complex financial matters. Someone with dementia might have capacity on good days but not on bad ones.</p>
    <p>Modern law recognizes this complexity. Instead of declaring someone "incompetent," courts now assess whether a person has capacity for specific decisions at specific times. The focus is on what the person can and can't do, not on labeling them.</p>
    <p>You're unlikely to see "incompetent" in contemporary legal documents. It's been replaced by terms like "lacks capacity," "incapacitated," or "unable to make informed decisions"—language that's more accurate and less demeaning.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>If you encounter the term "incompetent" in estate planning, it's probably in an old document.</p>
  <p>Some wills or powers of attorney written decades ago might include clauses that refer to someone becoming "incompetent" or being "declared incompetent by a court." These provisions were meant to trigger certain actions—like a backup attorney taking over, or a trust being established to manage someone's affairs.</p>
  <p>Today, those same provisions would be drafted differently. Instead of talking about incompetence, modern documents refer to incapacity or loss of capacity, often with specific criteria about how capacity should be assessed (for example, requiring a medical opinion from two doctors).</p>
  <p>The shift in language reflects a broader change in how we think about capacity. The old approach was binary and stigmatizing. The modern approach is functional: it asks whether someone can understand and make a particular decision, not whether they can be labeled as competent or incompetent overall.</p>
  <p>If you're writing a will or power of attorney now, use current terminology. It's more respectful, more legally accurate, and less likely to cause confusion or offense.</p>
