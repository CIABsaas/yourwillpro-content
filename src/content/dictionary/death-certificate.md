    <p>A death certificate is the official government document that proves someone has died. It's issued by the vital records office or similar authority after a doctor certifies the death and the necessary paperwork is filed.</p>
    <p>You'll need multiple copies of this document. Almost every organization you deal with after someone dies will ask for it—banks, insurance companies, government agencies, the probate court. They need proof of death before they'll release assets, pay claims, or transfer accounts.</p>
    <p>The certificate contains key information: who died, when, where, and what caused their death. It becomes part of the permanent public record. Getting copies usually requires going through the vital records office in the jurisdiction where the death occurred.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>Death certificates are essential for estate administration. Executors typically order 10-15 certified copies at the outset because you can't do much without them. Each organization wants an original certified copy—photocopies usually aren't accepted.</p>
  <p>You'll need death certificates to: access bank accounts, claim life insurance, transfer property titles, close credit cards, collect pension benefits, file estate tax returns, and distribute assets to beneficiaries. The list is extensive. Running out of copies mid-administration creates delays.</p>
  <p>Getting additional copies later is possible but often slower and more expensive than ordering multiple copies initially. The funeral director or hospital usually helps families obtain the first batch. After that, you order directly from the vital records office, which can take weeks depending on the jurisdiction.</p>
