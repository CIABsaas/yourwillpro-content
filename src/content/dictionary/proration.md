    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>The proportional allocation of estate taxes, debts, or administration expenses among estate beneficiaries based on the value of their respective shares or inheritances. Proration ensures fair distribution of burdens in proportion to benefits received, unless the will specifies otherwise.</p>

    <p>Proration means dividing up estate costs fairly based on what each person inherits. If you inherit 60% of an estate, you'd typically pay 60% of the estate taxes and expenses. It's about making sure everyone pays their fair share of the costs based on what they're receiving.</p>

  <div class="example-label">EXAMPLE</div>
  <p>"The estate had $500,000 in assets and $50,000 in taxes and expenses. I inherited 40% and my sister got 60%, so through proration, I paid $20,000 of the costs and she paid $30,000, each proportional to what we received."</p>

  <h3>⚖️ Compare: Proration vs Equal Division</h3>
  <div class="compare-grid">
    <div class="compare-item">
      <div class="compare-term">Proration</div>
      <p>Costs divided proportionally based on what each beneficiary receives. Fair when inheritances are unequal—larger shares bear larger costs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="compare-item">
      <div class="compare-term">Equal Division</div>
      <p>Costs split equally regardless of inheritance size. Can be unfair if one person inherits much more than others but pays same expenses.</p>

<div class="did-you-know">
  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>Wills can override proration and specify that one beneficiary pays all taxes or that taxes come from the residuary estate before distribution. Without such direction, most jurisdictions default to prorating taxes and expenses among all beneficiaries proportionally.</p>
