    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>

    <p>A surety is someone who promises to pay up or perform if you don't. In estate matters, courts sometimes require executors to get a surety bond—basically insurance that guarantees they won't steal or mismanage the estate.</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>Most wills include a clause waiving the bond requirement for executors to save the estate money. However, courts can still require a bond if they believe there's significant risk—particularly if beneficiaries object or the executor has credibility issues.</p>
