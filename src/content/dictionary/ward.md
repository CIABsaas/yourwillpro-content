  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>The term "ward" comes from old English meaning "to guard" or "to protect." A ward can be both a minor and a beneficiary—for example, a child who inherits money might be a ward (needing a guardian for personal decisions) and also a trust beneficiary (with a trustee managing their inheritance).</p>
