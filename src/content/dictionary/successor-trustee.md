    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>A successor trustee is the backup person who takes over managing a trust when the current trustee can't do it anymore—whether because they died, became incapacitated, resigned, or were removed. It's like naming an understudy in case the main person can't perform.</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>It's wise to name multiple levels of successor trustees—a first successor, second successor, and so on—to ensure someone can always serve. If all named trustees are unable or unwilling, a court must appoint one, which can be time-consuming and expensive.</p>
