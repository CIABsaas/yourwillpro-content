    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>**Common Law Marriage** (noun) — A marital relationship recognized by some jurisdictions based on the couple living together and presenting themselves as married, without a formal ceremony or marriage license.</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>Common law marriage means being considered legally married without having an official ceremony or marriage license. In places that recognize it, if you live together as a couple and present yourselves as married for sufficient time, you become legally married.</p>
    <p>The requirements vary significantly by jurisdiction. Some places don't recognize common law marriage at all. Others require specific elements: living together for a certain period, presenting yourselves publicly as married, intending to be married, and sometimes consummating the relationship.</p>
    <p>Many people mistakenly believe common law marriage happens automatically after living together for a certain time. In reality, where it exists, it requires more than just cohabitation—you must hold yourselves out as married.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>Common law marriage affects estate planning significantly. If you're in a common law marriage, your partner has the same inheritance rights as a formally married spouse. If you're living together but not in a common law marriage, they have no automatic inheritance rights at all.</p>
  <p>This distinction matters when someone dies without a will. A common law spouse might inherit everything under intestacy laws, while a partner in a jurisdiction that doesn't recognize common law marriage gets nothing unless named in a will.</p>
  <p>You'll encounter this issue when administering estates in jurisdictions that recognize common law marriage, or when couples have moved between jurisdictions with different rules. Proving or disproving a common law marriage can be complex, requiring evidence of how the couple presented themselves, what they told others, and how they structured their affairs.</p>

  <p>"My partner and I lived together for 15 years and everyone thought we were married, but Queensland doesn't recognize common law marriage, so when he died without a will, I inherited nothing as his de facto partner."</p>
