    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>**Contingent Beneficiary** (noun) — A person or entity designated to receive assets or benefits only if the primary beneficiary is unable or unwilling to receive them, typically due to death or disclaimer.</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>A contingent beneficiary is your backup plan. They're the person who inherits only if your first choice (the primary beneficiary) can't or doesn't—usually because the primary beneficiary died before you, disclaimed the inheritance, or other specified circumstances occurred.</p>
    <p>Think of it as "if X doesn't work out, then Y." You might name your spouse as primary beneficiary and your children as contingent beneficiaries. If your spouse survives you, they inherit. If they don't, the gift goes to your children instead.</p>
    <p>Contingent beneficiaries are essential to avoid intestacy. If your only named beneficiary dies before you and you haven't named contingent beneficiaries, that gift either lapses into your residuary estate or, if it's your entire estate, distributes according to intestacy laws.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>You'll name contingent beneficiaries in wills, trusts, life insurance policies, retirement accounts, and any document designating who receives assets. They provide clarity about your wishes if your first choice can't inherit.</p>
  <p>The relationship between primary and contingent beneficiaries must be clear in the document. Terms like "if my daughter doesn't survive me" or "if my sister disclaims" specify when the contingent beneficiary steps in. Ambiguity leads to disputes.</p>
  <p>When reviewing beneficiary designations, check whether contingent beneficiaries are named and still appropriate. People often name contingent beneficiaries when setting up accounts then forget to update them after circumstances change. Your contingent beneficiary from 20 years ago might not be who you'd choose today.</p>
