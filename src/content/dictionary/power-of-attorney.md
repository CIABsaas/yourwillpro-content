    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>A legal instrument by which one person (the principal) grants authority to another person (the attorney or agent) to act on the principal's behalf for specified purposes. Can be general (covering all matters) or limited (specific matters), and ordinary (ending if principal loses capacity) or enduring (continuing despite incapacity). Effective only during the principal's lifetime; terminates automatically upon death.</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>A document that lets you appoint someone to make decisions and handle your affairs while you're alive. Not the same as a will (which operates after death)—it's about giving someone authority to act for you now or in the future if you can't manage yourself. Might be needed if you become ill, injured, mentally incapable, or are traveling overseas. The person you appoint can make financial decisions, sign documents, and handle transactions on your behalf.</p>

  <div class="example-label">EXAMPLE</div>
  <p>"When Mum was diagnosed with dementia, we were grateful she'd made an enduring power of attorney years earlier appointing my sister and me. We could manage her finances, pay bills, and sell her house for aged care, all without needing court guardianship."</p>
</div>

<div class="why-matters">
  <h3>💡 Why this matters</h3>
  <p>Without a power of attorney, if you become incapacitated, nobody—not even your spouse or children—can legally make financial decisions for you. They'll need to apply to court for guardianship, a costly and time-consuming process that can take months while bills go unpaid and your affairs are frozen.</p>
  <p>Having the right type of power of attorney in place before you need it protects both you and your family.</p>
</div>

<div class="common-mistakes">
  <h3>⚠️ Common mistakes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Confusing power of attorney (for lifetime) with executor (for after death)</li>
    <li>Using a general POA when you need an enduring POA—general ones stop working if you lose capacity</li>
    <li>Not making one because you're young and healthy—accidents and sudden illness happen</li>
    <li>Appointing someone without discussing the responsibility or ensuring they understand their duties</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="did-you-know">
  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>A power of attorney stops working the moment you die—at that point, your executor takes over. This confuses many people who think their attorney can continue managing affairs after death. If you become incapacitated, your enduring power of attorney manages your affairs. When you die, your executor takes over. These are two different roles for two different time periods.</p>
