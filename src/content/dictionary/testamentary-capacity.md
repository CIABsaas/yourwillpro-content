    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>The legal and mental competence required to execute a valid will. Generally requires the testator to understand the nature of making a will, the extent of their property, the natural objects of their bounty (family), and how the will distributes their estate. The standard is lower than general contractual capacity.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column-card plain-column">
    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>Testamentary capacity means you're mentally capable of making a will. You need to know what you own, who your family is, and what your will does. It's a pretty low bar—even people with some mental decline often have testamentary capacity.</p>

<div class="example-box">
  <div class="example-label">EXAMPLE</div>
  <p>"My uncle contested Grandma's will, claiming she lacked testamentary capacity due to dementia. But her lawyer had her examined by a doctor before signing, who confirmed she understood her assets, her family relationships, and what the will did—that was enough for testamentary capacity."</p>

      <p>Lower threshold. For wills only. Understand assets, family, will's effect. Can have despite some impairment.</p>

    <div class="compare-item">
      <div class="compare-term">Contractual Capacity</div>

<div class="why-matters">
  <h3>💡 Why this matters</h3>
  <p>If you lack testamentary capacity when making a will, it's invalid. But capacity isn't all-or-nothing—someone with dementia or mental illness can still have good days where they understand enough to make a valid will. Getting a medical assessment at the time of signing provides crucial evidence if the will is later challenged.</p>
  <p>This protects both the person making the will and the beneficiaries.</p>
</div>

<div class="common-mistakes">
  <h3>⚠️ Common mistakes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Assuming someone with a diagnosis automatically lacks capacity—diagnosis doesn't equal incapacity</li>
    <li>Not getting a doctor's assessment when capacity is questionable, leaving the will vulnerable to challenge</li>
    <li>Confusing testamentary capacity with contractual capacity—the will threshold is much lower</li>
    <li>Making a will during a hospital stay or medication that affects cognition without documenting a lucid moment</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="did-you-know">
  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>The test for testamentary capacity was established in 1870 in the famous English case Banks v Goodfellow and is still used in many common law countries today. It's deliberately set at a low threshold to allow people to make wills even if they have some cognitive decline.</p>
