    <p>The legal right to ownership of property, or the documentary evidence establishing that ownership. Title represents the bundle of rights that come with property ownership, including the right to possess, use, transfer, and exclude others. Also refers to the document (like a deed) that proves ownership.</p>

    <p>Title means legal ownership of something—you have title to your house, your car. It's also the document that proves you own it, like a property deed or car title. Having good title means you truly own it with no disputes.</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>Title insurance protects against defects in title—like discovering someone else has a valid claim to property you thought you owned. When buying real estate, lawyers do a "title search" to verify the seller actually has good title to transfer to you.</p>
