    <p>**Intestacy** (noun) — The condition or state of a person dying without having made a valid will, or dying with a will that does not effectively dispose of all their property. When intestacy occurs, the deceased's estate is distributed according to the statutory rules of intestate succession rather than according to the deceased's expressed wishes.</p>

    <p>Intestacy is what happens when someone dies without a valid will—or with a will that doesn't cover everything they own.</p>
    <p>If you die intestate, the law steps in and decides who inherits your property. There's a formula set out in legislation that determines the order: typically your spouse or partner first, then children, then parents, then siblings, and so on through increasingly distant relatives. The exact rules and shares vary by jurisdiction, but the principle is the same everywhere—the law makes a will for you based on assumptions about what most people would want.</p>
    <p>Intestacy can be total or partial. Total intestacy means you had no will at all. Partial intestacy means you had a will, but it didn't dispose of everything—perhaps you acquired property after making the will, or a gift in your will failed because the intended beneficiary died before you.</p>
    <p>The intestacy rules are designed to provide a fair and predictable outcome when someone dies without expressing their wishes. But "fair" according to the law might not match what you would have wanted. The rules don't account for complicated family dynamics, special needs, or personal relationships outside legal categories like marriage or parenthood.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>Understanding intestacy helps explain why making a will matters.</p>
  <p>The intestacy rules might work fine if your family situation is straightforward and your wishes align with what the law would do anyway. If you're married with children and you'd want everything to go to your spouse and then your kids, intestacy might achieve that outcome—though even then, the specific shares might not match your intentions.</p>
  <p>But intestacy creates problems in many common situations. If you have a partner you're not married to, they might get nothing under intestacy laws—the property could go to your children or other relatives instead. If you want to leave something to a friend, a charity, or a step-child who isn't legally your child, intestacy won't accomplish that. If your family relationships are complicated—estranged relatives, blended families, dependents with special needs—the intestacy rules won't account for those nuances.</p>
  <p>Intestacy also adds complexity and cost to estate administration. When there's no will, someone has to apply for letters of administration rather than probate, which can be more complicated. And if there's uncertainty about who the rightful heirs are, or if distant relatives need to be tracked down, the process can take significantly longer.</p>
  <p>The best way to avoid intestacy is simple: make a will. Even a basic will gives you control over who inherits, appoints your executor, and can name guardians for your children. And if your circumstances change, you can update it.</p>
