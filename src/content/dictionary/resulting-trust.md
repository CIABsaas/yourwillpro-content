    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>A trust implied by law that arises when property is transferred but the transferor's intention regarding beneficial ownership is unclear, incomplete, or fails. The law presumes the transferor did not intend to make a gift, so beneficial ownership "results" back to the transferor or their estate despite legal title passing to another.</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>A resulting trust happens when you transfer property to someone but it's unclear whether you meant it as a gift or for another purpose. If you can't prove you intended a gift, the law assumes you still own it beneficially even though someone else holds legal title.</p>

  <div class="example-label">EXAMPLE</div>
  <p>"Mum put the house in my name to avoid probate, but we had no written agreement about whether she was giving it to me or just having me hold it for convenience. When she died, the court found a resulting trust—I held legal title but Mum's estate owned it beneficially, so it had to be distributed according to her will."</p>

<div class="did-you-know">
  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>Resulting trusts are based on the presumption that people don't usually give away property without intending to. If you transfer your house to your child without clear evidence of a gift, the law may presume you meant them to hold it in trust for you.</p>
