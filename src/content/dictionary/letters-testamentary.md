    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>**Letters testamentary** (noun) — A court-issued document that formally confirms the appointment of an executor named in a will and grants them legal authority to administer the deceased's estate. In many jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, letters testamentary is the term used for what is elsewhere called a grant of probate. The document proves to third parties that the executor has legal authority to act on behalf of the estate.</p>

    <p>Letters testamentary is the official court document that proves you're authorized to act as executor of someone's estate.</p>
    <p>When someone dies and leaves a will naming you as executor, you don't automatically have legal authority to deal with their assets. You need to apply to the court for formal recognition of your appointment. The court reviews the will, confirms it's valid, and issues letters testamentary—the document that gives you the power to access bank accounts, sell property, and do everything else required to administer the estate.</p>
    <p>The term is most commonly used in the United States. In Australia and the UK, the equivalent document is called a grant of probate. But regardless of what it's called, the function is the same: it's your proof of authority as executor.</p>
    <p>Without letters testamentary, banks won't let you access accounts, land registries won't let you transfer property, and other institutions won't deal with you. You need that official court document to demonstrate you have legal standing to act on behalf of the estate.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>Getting letters testamentary is usually one of the first steps in estate administration.</p>
  <p>The process typically involves:
- Filing an application with the appropriate court
- Submitting the original will and death certificate
- Providing notice to beneficiaries and interested parties
- Sometimes providing a bond or security
- Swearing or affirming that you'll faithfully discharge your duties</p>
  <p>Once the court is satisfied that the will is valid, you're the person named as executor, and all requirements are met, it issues the letters testamentary. This usually takes several weeks to several months, depending on the jurisdiction and complexity of the estate.</p>
  <p>The letters testamentary give you broad powers to administer the estate, but they also impose serious responsibilities. As executor, you're a fiduciary—you must act honestly, avoid conflicts of interest, keep proper accounts, and follow the terms of the will and the requirements of law.</p>
  <p>In some jurisdictions, letters testamentary are issued with specific powers listed, while in others they grant general authority to do whatever is necessary to administer the estate properly. Either way, the document is your legal authorization to act.</p>
  <p>You'll need to provide copies of letters testamentary to banks, investment firms, insurance companies, government agencies, and anyone else holding assets of the estate. Most institutions will want to see an official copy with the court seal, not just a photocopy.</p>
  <p>If you're dealing with property in multiple jurisdictions, you might need to obtain ancillary letters testamentary in each location. For example, if the deceased lived in one state but owned property in another, you might need letters testamentary from the probate court in each state.</p>
  <p>Letters testamentary remain in effect until the estate is fully administered and closed, at which point your authority as executor ends. If you need to resign before completion, the court can revoke the letters and appoint a successor executor.</p>
