    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>Death taxes is a catch-all term for taxes triggered when someone dies and their property passes to others. The most common types are estate taxes (taxes on the total value of everything you owned) and inheritance taxes (taxes on what individual beneficiaries receive).</p>
    <p>Not everyone pays death taxes. Many jurisdictions have thresholds—only estates above a certain value get taxed. The amount varies widely by location and changes over time as laws are updated.</p>
    <p>The distinction between estate tax and inheritance tax matters. Estate tax is calculated on the whole estate before distribution. Inheritance tax is calculated on what each beneficiary receives. Some places have one, some have the other, some have both, and some have neither.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>Death taxes can significantly reduce what beneficiaries actually receive. A large estate might lose a substantial portion to tax before anything is distributed. This is why estate planning often focuses on minimizing death taxes through trusts, gifts during lifetime, or other strategies.</p>
  <p>The executor is responsible for calculating, reporting, and paying any death taxes owed. This typically happens before distributing assets to beneficiaries. Failure to pay death taxes can result in penalties and personal liability for the executor.</p>
  <p>You'll encounter death tax issues when administering estates above the threshold amount, when beneficiaries are in different tax jurisdictions, or when dealing with complex asset types. Professional advice is essential for estates that might owe significant death taxes. The rules are intricate, and proper planning can make a substantial difference to what beneficiaries ultimately receive.</p>
