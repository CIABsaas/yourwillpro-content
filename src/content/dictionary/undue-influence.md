    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>Excessive persuasion, pressure, or manipulation that overcomes the free will of a testator or settlor, causing them to execute a will or trust contrary to their true wishes. Undue influence requires showing the influencer had opportunity, motive, and actually exerted pressure that substituted their will for the testator's independent judgment.</p>

    <p>Undue influence is when someone pressures or manipulates you into making a will that reflects their wishes, not yours. It's more than just persuasion—it's crossing the line into coercion that overpowers your own free choice.</p>

<div class="did-you-know">
  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>Courts are particularly suspicious of undue influence when a caregiver, attorney, or person in a position of trust receives large unexpected gifts or inheritance. Many jurisdictions have laws creating a presumption of undue influence in these situations, shifting the burden to the recipient to prove the gift was legitimate.</p>
