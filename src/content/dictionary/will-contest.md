    <p>A will contest is when someone goes to court to challenge a will, claiming it's not valid. Common reasons include arguing the person lacked mental capacity, was pressured to sign it, or the will wasn't properly signed and witnessed.</p>

  <p>"Dad's final will, signed two weeks before he died of cancer, left everything to his caregiver instead of us. We filed a will contest claiming he lacked capacity and she exercised undue influence. After reviewing medical records and deposing witnesses, we settled—the caregiver got a small payment, we got the estate."</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>Many wills include "no-contest" or "in terrorem" clauses that disinherit anyone who unsuccessfully contests the will. These clauses deter frivolous challenges but don't prevent legitimate contests—most jurisdictions allow contests if there's probable cause to believe the will is invalid.</p>
