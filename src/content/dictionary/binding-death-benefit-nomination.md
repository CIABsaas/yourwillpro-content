    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>**Binding Death Benefit Nomination** (noun) — A formal nomination made in accordance with superannuation trust deed requirements and legislation, which binds the trustee to pay death benefits to the nominated beneficiary or beneficiaries, provided the nomination is valid and the nominees are eligible dependants or the estate.</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>When you make a binding death benefit nomination, you're giving your super fund a legally enforceable instruction about who gets your super when you die. Unlike a non-binding nomination (which the fund can ignore), a binding nomination must be followed—if it's valid.</p>
    <p>This takes the decision out of the trustee's hands. They don't exercise discretion; they simply pay according to your nomination.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>To be valid, a binding nomination must meet specific requirements: it must be in writing, signed and dated by you in the presence of two witnesses (who must be over 18 and not named beneficiaries), and it usually expires after three years (though some funds now offer non-lapsing binding nominations).</p>
  <p>You can only nominate eligible people: your dependants (spouse, children, someone financially dependent on you, or someone in an interdependency relationship with you) or your estate. If you nominate your estate, your super becomes part of your estate and gets distributed according to your will. Many people do this to maintain consistency between their super and will, though there can be tax implications to consider.</p>

  <div class="example-label">EXAMPLE</div>
  <p>"I made a binding death benefit nomination for my super, naming my husband as the beneficiary. Because it's binding and properly witnessed, the fund must pay him my super when I die."</p>

<div class="why-matters">
  <h3>💡 Why this matters</h3>
  <p>Without a valid binding nomination, the super fund trustee has complete discretion over who gets your super—potentially ignoring your wishes entirely. A binding nomination removes this uncertainty, ensuring your super goes exactly where you want it. But if it's invalid or expired, it's worthless.</p>
  <p>Regular reviews are essential to ensure your nomination remains valid and reflects your current wishes.</p>

<div class="common-mistakes">
  <h3>⚠️ Common mistakes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Signing the form without proper witnesses, making it invalid</li>
    <li>Not renewing every 3 years—expired nominations become non-binding</li>
    <li>Nominating someone who isn't an eligible dependant (like a friend or sibling)</li>
    <li>Making conflicting nominations across multiple super funds without reviewing them together</li>
  </ul>
