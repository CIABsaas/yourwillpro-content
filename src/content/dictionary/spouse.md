    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>A married partner in a legally recognized marriage or, in many jurisdictions, a de facto partner who meets certain criteria for relationship recognition. Spouses have special legal rights regarding inheritance, property ownership, family provision claims, and spousal maintenance, varying by jurisdiction and relationship status.</p>

    <p>Your spouse is your husband, wife, or in many places, your de facto partner if you've lived together long enough. Spouses have special inheritance rights—they typically inherit automatically under intestacy laws and can claim against estates that don't adequately provide for them.</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
