    <p>**Gross Estate** (noun) — The total value of all property, assets, and interests owned by a deceased person at the time of death, calculated before deducting any debts, expenses, or taxes, used primarily for estate tax purposes and probate administration.</p>

    <p>Your gross estate is everything you own when you die, added up to a total value. It includes your house, bank accounts, investments, superannuation, business interests, personal property, and anything else of value. The "gross" part means this is the total before subtracting any debts or expenses you owe.</p>
    <p>The gross estate is different from what beneficiaries actually receive. After calculating the gross estate, you subtract debts, funeral expenses, estate administration costs, and any applicable taxes. What's left after all these deductions is the net estate, which is what gets distributed to beneficiaries.</p>
    <p>Understanding your gross estate matters for estate planning, particularly in jurisdictions with estate taxes. If your gross estate exceeds certain thresholds, taxes might be owed before anything can be distributed. Knowing the value helps you plan accordingly and potentially take steps to reduce the taxable estate.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>In jurisdictions with estate tax, the executor must calculate the gross estate to determine if tax is owed. This involves valuing every asset at its fair market value as of the date of death. Real estate needs appraisals, businesses need valuations, and all financial accounts must be tallied.</p>
  <p>The gross estate can include some assets you might not expect. Life insurance proceeds are included if you owned the policy. Retirement accounts and superannuation are generally part of the gross estate. Property you gave away but retained some control over or benefit from might still be included. Joint property is included at least partially, depending on the ownership structure and who provided the funds to purchase it.</p>
  <p>For most people, particularly in countries without estate tax like Australia, the gross estate calculation is mainly an accounting exercise to understand what assets exist and what they're worth. The executor uses this information to properly administer the estate and ensure fair distribution, even if no tax is involved.</p>
