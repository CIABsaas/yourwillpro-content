    <p>Probate property is simply another way of saying "probate assets"—it's any property you own that has to go through probate court when you die. This includes things like a house in your sole name, bank accounts without beneficiaries, or personal belongings. Property held jointly or with beneficiary designations isn't probate property.</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>The same type of asset can be probate property or non-probate property depending solely on how it's titled. A bank account in your name alone is probate property, but the exact same account with "payable on death" designation becomes non-probate property.</p>
