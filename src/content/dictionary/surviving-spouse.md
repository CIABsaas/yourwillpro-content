    <p>Your surviving spouse is your husband or wife who's still alive after you die. The law gives surviving spouses special protections—they can't usually be completely disinherited and often get tax advantages other beneficiaries don't receive.</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>In many jurisdictions, a surviving spouse automatically inherits some portion of the estate even if the will says otherwise. This is called the "elective share" or "forced share" and typically ranges from one-third to one-half of the estate, protecting spouses from being disinherited.</p>
