    <p>To disinherit someone means to deliberately cut them out of your will so they don't receive anything from your estate. This usually happens when you want to exclude someone who would normally inherit from you, like a child or spouse.</p>
    <p>Simply not mentioning someone in your will isn't always enough to disinherit them. In many cases, you need to explicitly state that you're leaving them out on purpose. Otherwise, they might argue that you simply forgot to include them, and a court could give them a share anyway.</p>
    <p>Different jurisdictions have different rules about who you can and can't disinherit. In some places, you can't completely disinherit a spouse. In others, minor children have protections that prevent total disinheritance.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>Disinheritance is a sensitive topic because it often reflects family conflict. You might choose to disinherit someone because of estrangement, past behavior, or because you've already provided for them in other ways during your lifetime.</p>
  <p>If you want to disinherit someone, it's important to do it clearly and correctly. Courts sometimes overturn disinheritance if it's not done properly. You should state the person's name and make it clear that the exclusion is intentional, not an oversight. Some people include a brief explanation, though this isn't always required.</p>
  <p>Be aware that even if you successfully disinherit someone, they may still be able to challenge your will through a family provision claim if they were financially dependent on you or had a reasonable expectation of support from your estate.</p>
