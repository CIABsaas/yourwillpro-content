    <p>An agent is someone you give permission to act for you. They might sign documents on your behalf, make decisions, or handle transactions—depending on what authority you've given them.</p>
    <p>The relationship requires trust: your agent can bind you legally to whatever they do within their authority.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>In estate planning, the term agent often appears in powers of attorney, where you appoint someone as your attorney (agent) to make financial or medical decisions if you can't.</p>
  <p>The scope of an agent's authority should be clearly defined. A general power of attorney gives broad powers; a limited power might only authorize specific transactions, like selling a particular property. Always choose someone trustworthy and capable—your agent's decisions are legally your decisions.</p>
