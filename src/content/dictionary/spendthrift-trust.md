    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>A trust containing a spendthrift clause that restricts the beneficiary's ability to transfer their interest and shields trust assets from the beneficiary's creditors. The trustee has discretion over distributions, protecting against improvident beneficiaries who might waste the inheritance or have it seized by creditors.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column-card plain-column">
    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>A spendthrift trust protects inheritance from irresponsible beneficiaries and their creditors. The trustee controls when and how much money is distributed, so a spendthrift beneficiary can't blow through their inheritance immediately or have creditors seize it before they receive it.</p>

  <p>"Grandma set up a spendthrift trust for my cousin who has struggled with addiction and debt.

It keeps him housed and fed without enabling his problems."</p>

<div class="did-you-know">
  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>You cannot create a spendthrift trust for yourself—you can't shield your own assets from your creditors by putting them in a spendthrift trust where you're the beneficiary. Spendthrift protection only works for trusts created by someone else for your benefit.</p>
