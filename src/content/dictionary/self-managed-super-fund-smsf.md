    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>A self-managed superannuation fund is a private superannuation trust structure regulated by the Australian Taxation Office, with members acting as trustees who have direct control over investment decisions and fund management. SMSFs must comply with strict superannuation and taxation laws, and are subject to annual audits and regulatory reporting.</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>An SMSF is a do-it-yourself super fund where you're in control instead of a bank or super company. You and up to five other members manage the investments yourselves, deciding where the money goes. With control comes responsibility—you must follow strict rules and handle all the paperwork and compliance.</p>

  <div class="example-label">EXAMPLE</div>
  <p>"Dad set up an SMSF with $800,000 in it. As trustee, he controlled the investments directly—bought property, shares, and other assets. When he died, we had to deal with his binding death benefit nomination to work out who received the SMSF balance and whether it would be paid as a lump sum or pension."</p>

    <div class="compare-item">
      <div class="compare-term">SMSF</div>
      <p>You control investments directly. More flexibility but more responsibility. Must handle compliance, audits, reporting yourself.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="compare-item">
      <div class="compare-term">Retail Super Fund</div>
      <p>Professional management handles everything. Limited investment choices. Less control but less administrative burden.</p>

<div class="did-you-know">
  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>SMSFs don't automatically pass through your will when you die—they're controlled by the fund's trust deed and any binding death benefit nominations you've made. Estate planning with an SMSF requires specific strategies separate from your will.</p>
