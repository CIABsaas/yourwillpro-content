    <p>A comprehensive model statute drafted by the Uniform Law Commission to standardize and modernize probate, trust, and estate laws across U.S. states. While not binding, many states have adopted all or portions of the UPC, creating greater consistency in areas like intestate succession, will execution, probate procedures, and trust law.</p>

    <p>The Uniform Probate Code is a set of suggested laws about wills, trusts, and estates that many states have adopted (wholly or partly) to make estate law more consistent across the U.S. It's a template, not federal law—each state decides whether to use it.</p>
