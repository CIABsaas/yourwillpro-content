    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>**Joint tenancy** (noun) — A form of co-ownership where two or more people hold property together with equal, undivided interests and a right of survivorship. The defining feature is that when one joint tenant dies, their interest automatically passes to the surviving joint tenant(s) rather than forming part of the deceased's estate. Joint tenancy requires four unities: possession (equal right to possess the whole property), interest (equal shares), title (interests created by the same document), and time (interests created simultaneously).</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>Joint tenancy is a way for two or more people to own property together as equals, where the survivors automatically inherit when one owner dies.</p>
    <p>It's most commonly used by married couples for their family home, but it can apply to any property—houses, bank accounts, investment accounts, or land. The key feature is the right of survivorship: when one joint tenant dies, the surviving joint tenants automatically become the owners of the whole property.</p>
    <p>This is different from tenancy in common, where each owner has a distinct share that passes through their estate when they die. With joint tenancy, there are no separate shares—everyone owns the whole property together, and when someone dies, the survivors simply continue owning it.</p>
    <p>To create a joint tenancy, specific language is usually required in the deed or title document. In some jurisdictions, joint tenancy is the default for married couples buying property together. In others, you need to explicitly state that you're creating a joint tenancy.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>Joint tenancy is a powerful tool for estate planning, but it comes with both advantages and limitations.</p>
  <p>The main benefit is avoiding probate. When property is held in joint tenancy, it doesn't form part of the deceased's estate. The survivor automatically becomes the owner without needing a grant of probate or letters of administration. For a family home or bank account, this means the surviving spouse or partner has immediate access without waiting for estate administration.</p>
  <p>This can also save money. Property that passes outside the estate avoids probate fees and might reduce legal costs. And it's simple—the property just continues in the name of the survivors.</p>
  <p>But joint tenancy has drawbacks you need to understand:</p>
  <p>First, you can't control what happens through your will. If you own property in joint tenancy, your share automatically goes to the surviving joint tenants when you die—regardless of what your will says. You can't leave your interest to anyone else.</p>
  <p>Second, all joint tenants must agree to sell or mortgage the property. You can't act unilaterally. If relationships break down or one joint tenant becomes incapacitated, this can create problems.</p>
  <p>Third, a joint tenant can sever the joint tenancy unilaterally by transferring their interest to themselves as a tenant in common. This destroys the right of survivorship without the other owners' consent.</p>
  <p>Fourth, joint tenancy doesn't solve all succession problems. It only works for one generation—when the last joint tenant dies, the property goes through their estate anyway.</p>
  <p>Joint tenancy works well for simple situations like a marital home. But for more complex estates, particularly with blended families or where you want to control who ultimately inherits, other arrangements like trusts might be more appropriate.</p>

<div class="why-matters">
  <h3>💡 Why this matters</h3>
  <p>Joint tenancy means your property passes automatically to survivors, bypassing your will and probate. This can be exactly what you want—or completely contrary to your wishes. Many people don't realize joint tenancy overrides their will, leading to unintended outcomes when assets go to joint owners instead of intended beneficiaries.</p>
  <p>Understanding joint tenancy helps you use it strategically rather than accidentally.</p>
