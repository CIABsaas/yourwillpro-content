    <p>The trust agreement is the document that creates the trust. It's like the trust's rulebook—it says who manages the trust (trustee), who benefits from it (beneficiaries), what property goes in it, and how it should be run.</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>A trust agreement can be amended or revoked if it's a revocable trust, allowing the settlor to change terms during their lifetime. But once it becomes irrevocable—either by its own terms or the settlor's death—the trust agreement generally cannot be changed without court approval or beneficiary consent.</p>
