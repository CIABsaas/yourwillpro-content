    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>A person who holds a remainder interest in property—the right to receive full ownership after a prior estate (typically a life estate) terminates. The remainderman's interest is future, becoming possessory only upon the death or other termination of the life tenant's interest.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column-card plain-column">
    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>A remainderman is the person who gets property after someone else's lifetime use ends. For example, if your dad's will gives his house to his wife for her lifetime, then to you after she dies, you're the remainderman. You have to wait for her life estate to end before you get full ownership.</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>Remaindermen have the right to ensure the life tenant doesn't "waste" the property—meaning seriously damage or deplete its value. If a life tenant is destroying a property, remaindermen can go to court to stop it, even though they don't yet have possession.</p>
