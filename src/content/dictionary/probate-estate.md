    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>The assets owned by a decedent in their sole name that must pass through probate court and are subject to court supervision during administration. Excludes non-probate assets such as jointly-owned property, assets with beneficiary designations, and trust assets.</p>

    <p>Your probate estate is the stuff you own in your own name that has to go through probate court when you die. It doesn't include things like joint bank accounts, life insurance with named beneficiaries, or assets in a trust—those bypass probate. Only assets in your sole name make up your probate estate.</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>A person can die with millions in assets but have a very small probate estate—or even none at all—if they structured ownership through trusts, joint ownership, and beneficiary designations. This is why probate avoidance strategies focus on how assets are titled, not just their value.</p>
