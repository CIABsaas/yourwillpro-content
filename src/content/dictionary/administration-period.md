    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>**Administration Period** (noun) — The period commencing from the date of death and concluding when the executor or administrator has completed all tasks required to wind up the estate, including obtaining grant of representation, collecting assets, paying liabilities, and distributing to beneficiaries.</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>When someone dies, their estate doesn't get distributed immediately. There's a process to work through—applying for probate, gathering assets, paying debts, lodging tax returns, and eventually distributing what remains.</p>
    <p>The administration period is simply the time this all takes. For straightforward estates, this might be 6-12 months. For complex estates with business interests, disputes, or tax complications, it can take years.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>During this period, beneficiaries usually can't access their inheritance. The executor is working through a legal checklist that can't be rushed.</p>
  <p>If you're waiting for an inheritance, it's normal to feel frustrated by the delay. But the executor has legal duties to fulfill and can face personal liability if they distribute assets prematurely and something goes wrong. Patience, while difficult, protects everyone involved.</p>
