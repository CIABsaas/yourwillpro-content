    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>The act of cancelling, annulling, or withdrawing a previously made legal instrument such as a will, trust, power of attorney, or other revocable document. Revocation may be express (stating explicitly that the document is revoked) or implied (by physical destruction or making a new document that supersedes the old one).</p>
  </div>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>Revocation means cancelling a legal document. If you made a will ten years ago and want to cancel it, you can revoke it by destroying it, making a new will that says "I revoke all prior wills," or simply stating in writing that the old will is cancelled.</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>Marriage automatically revokes your will in most Australian states, but divorce doesn't—it only revokes gifts to your ex-spouse. This catches many people off guard who assume divorce cancels their entire will.</p>
