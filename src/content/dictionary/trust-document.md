    <p>The trust document is the written paperwork that creates the trust. It's the official document that explains what the trust is, who's involved, what property goes in it, and how it should operate. Without this document, there's no valid trust.</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>Trust documents can be quite lengthy—often 30-50 pages or more—because they need to cover many scenarios: what happens if beneficiaries die, how trustees should invest, when distributions occur, what happens in emergencies, tax provisions, and much more. Unlike a will, which is a one-time transfer, trusts need detailed ongoing operational rules.</p>
