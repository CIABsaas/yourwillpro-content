    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>A person or entity designated to hold legal title to property on behalf of another person (the beneficial owner). The nominee's name appears on legal documents, but they hold no beneficial interest and must act according to the beneficial owner's directions.</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>Someone who holds property in their name on behalf of the real owner. The nominee's name is on the legal paperwork (share register, title deed), but they don't own or control the property for themselves—they're holding it for the beneficial owner. Common in share trading accounts where your broker's nominee holds shares on your behalf. Can complicate estate planning if not properly documented.</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>Nominee-held assets can cause serious estate planning problems if not properly documented. When you die, your executor may struggle to prove you were the beneficial owner, especially if there's no written nominee agreement. Always keep records of nominee arrangements with your will.</p>
