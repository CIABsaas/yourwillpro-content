    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>Statutes establishing the order and manner in which property passes when a person dies intestate (without a will). These laws specify which relatives inherit, in what proportions, and in what priority order. Also known as intestacy laws or laws of intestate succession, they vary by jurisdiction but generally prioritize spouse, children, parents, siblings, and more distant relatives in descending order.</p>

    <p>Statutes of descent and distribution are the laws that decide who gets your stuff if you die without a will. They create a default inheritance plan based on your family relationships—typically your spouse and children first, then parents, siblings, and more distant relatives if you have no immediate family.</p>
