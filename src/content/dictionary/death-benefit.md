    <p>**Death Benefit** (noun) — A payment made to designated beneficiaries upon a person's death, typically from life insurance policies, retirement accounts, or employer-sponsored benefit plans.</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>A death benefit is money that gets paid out when you die. It comes from things like life insurance policies, superannuation funds, or retirement accounts that you set up during your lifetime to provide for people after you're gone.</p>
    <p>The amount varies widely. A life insurance policy might pay hundreds of thousands of dollars. A workplace retirement account pays whatever balance you've accumulated. The key feature is that this money goes directly to whoever you've named as beneficiary—it doesn't go through your will or estate.</p>
    <p>This direct payment is both an advantage and a potential complication. It's faster than probate and avoids estate creditors. But if your beneficiary designations are outdated or conflict with your will, it can create family disputes.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>Death benefits appear most commonly with life insurance and retirement accounts. When you set up these accounts, you name beneficiaries—the people who'll receive the money when you die. Those designations control where the death benefit goes, regardless of what your will says.</p>
  <p>This creates planning opportunities and pitfalls. You can use death benefits to provide immediate cash for funeral expenses or family needs. But you must keep beneficiary designations current. The ex-spouse you named 20 years ago still gets the death benefit if you never updated the form, even if your will leaves everything to your current spouse.</p>
  <p>You'll encounter death benefits when settling estates that include life insurance, superannuation, or retirement accounts. Executors don't control these assets—they go directly to named beneficiaries. This is why comprehensive estate planning reviews all beneficiary designations alongside your will. They need to work together, not against each other.</p>
