    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>**Letters of administration** (noun) — A court-issued document granting a person legal authority to administer the estate of someone who died without a valid will (intestate) or without appointing an executor. The person who receives letters of administration is called the administrator and has similar powers and duties to an executor, but their authority comes from the court rather than from the deceased's will.</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>Letters of administration is the official document from the court that gives you legal authority to deal with someone's estate when they died without a will or without naming an executor.</p>
    <p>It's the equivalent of probate, but for situations where there's no will. When someone dies with a valid will, the executor applies for a grant of probate. When someone dies without a will (or the will doesn't appoint an executor), someone needs to apply for letters of administration instead.</p>
    <p>The court document—the letters of administration—proves to banks, government agencies, and other institutions that you have legal authority to access the deceased's accounts, sell their property, pay their debts, and distribute what's left to the rightful heirs.</p>
    <p>Without letters of administration, you generally can't deal with the deceased's assets. Banks won't let you access accounts. Land registries won't let you transfer property. You're stuck—even if you're the deceased's spouse or child—until the court grants you the authority.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>Getting letters of administration is similar to getting probate, but there are some important differences.</p>
  <p>First, priority. When there's a will, the named executor has first right to apply for probate. But when there's no will, who applies for letters of administration? Each state and territory has rules setting out the order of priority—typically the spouse or de facto partner first, then adult children, then parents, then siblings, and so on. If you're entitled to the largest share of the estate under the intestacy rules, you generally have first priority to be appointed administrator.</p>
  <p>Second, the application process is often more complex. With probate, the will itself shows what the deceased wanted. With letters of administration, the court needs additional evidence—about the deceased's family situation, who the legal heirs are, whether anyone with higher priority objects to your appointment, and sometimes even proof of death and lack of a will.</p>
  <p>Third, administrators might face additional restrictions or requirements. Some courts require administrators to provide a bond or security to protect the estate. Some impose reporting requirements. Some limit the administrator's powers compared to what an executor would have.</p>
  <p>As administrator, your role is similar to an executor's: collect the assets, pay the debts, and distribute what's left. But instead of distributing according to the will, you distribute according to the intestacy laws of your state or territory.</p>
  <p>This means you don't have discretion about who gets what—the law sets it out in a fixed formula. You might personally think the deceased would have wanted to benefit someone in particular, but unless that person is entitled under the intestacy rules, you can't give them anything.</p>
  <p>The process takes time. In straightforward cases, you might receive letters of administration within a few months. In complex cases—disputed family relationships, uncertain heirs, or challenges to your appointment—it can take much longer.</p>
  <p>Once you have letters of administration, you have the same fundamental duties as an executor: act honestly, keep proper accounts, avoid conflicts of interest, and administer the estate efficiently and in accordance with the law.</p>

<div class="why-matters">
  <h3>💡 Why this matters</h3>
  <p>Without letters of administration, nobody can legally access the deceased's assets, even close family members. Bank accounts stay frozen, property can't be sold, and bills can't be paid from the estate. The application process typically takes 2-4 months and costs several thousand dollars—time and money that could be avoided with a simple will.</p>
  <p>Understanding this process helps families navigate intestate estates more quickly and avoid common delays.</p>

<div class="common-mistakes">
  <h3>⚠️ Common mistakes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Trying to access accounts or sell assets before getting letters of administration—this is illegal</li>
    <li>Not realizing there's a priority order—someone with lower priority can't apply if someone higher up is willing</li>
    <li>Assuming it's a quick process like showing a death certificate—it's a formal court application</li>
    <li>Not understanding the administrator must follow intestacy laws, not what they think the deceased would have wanted</li>
  </ul>
