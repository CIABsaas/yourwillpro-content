    <p>Real property is land and anything permanently attached to it—your house, your garage, a fence, landscaping. Basically, if you can't pick it up and move it, it's real property. Everything else (furniture, cars, jewelry) is personal property.</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>The term "real" in real property comes from Latin "res" meaning "thing," not from "real" meaning "genuine." It's also why real property transfers are called "real estate" transactions and appear in "real property records."</p>
