    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>**Bond** (noun) — A security provided to the court, typically by an administrator (less commonly by an executor), as a guarantee against the faithful performance of their duties and protection against loss to the estate through breach of those duties.</p>

    <p>In estate administration, a bond is like insurance that protects the estate from mismanagement. If an administrator mishandles the estate—whether through negligence, dishonesty, or poor decision-making—the bond can compensate the estate for losses.</p>
    <p>Executors named in a will usually don't need to provide a bond, because the testator trusted them enough to name them. But administrators appointed by the court (where there's no will) may be required to provide one.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>Bond requirements vary by jurisdiction and circumstance. Courts might waive the bond requirement if all beneficiaries are adults and consent, if the estate is very small, or if the administrator is a professional trustee company.</p>
  <p>The cost of obtaining a bond (which is typically an annual premium paid to a surety company) comes from the estate. For small estates, this cost can be significant relative to the estate's value. In many Australian jurisdictions, bond requirements have been relaxed or eliminated in recent years.</p>
