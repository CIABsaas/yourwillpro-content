    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>**Life interest** (noun) — A right to receive income from, or use of, property during a person's lifetime, without ownership of the underlying capital or asset. When the life interest holder dies, their right ends and the property passes to other beneficiaries. Life interests are commonly created in trusts, where one person receives the benefit during their life and others receive the capital afterward.</p>

    <p>A life interest gives you the right to use property or receive income from it for as long as you live, but you don't own it—when you die, it goes to someone else.</p>
    <p>It's similar to a life estate, but typically applies to a broader range of property and is often created through a trust rather than direct ownership. For example, your mother's will might create a trust giving your father a life interest in her estate. He receives all the income the estate generates for the rest of his life, but he doesn't own the underlying assets. When he dies, the capital goes to you and your siblings.</p>
    <p>The person with the life interest is often called the life tenant or income beneficiary. The people who receive the property after the life interest ends are called remaindermen or capital beneficiaries.</p>
    <p>Life interests are commonly used in wills to provide for a surviving spouse while ensuring children from a previous marriage ultimately inherit. Or they might provide for someone who can't manage a large inheritance—they get the income for life, but the capital is preserved and professionally managed.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>Life interests solve certain estate planning problems but create others that need careful consideration.</p>
  <p>The main appeal is balance: you can provide ongoing financial support to one person while guaranteeing the capital eventually goes to others. A widow receives income for life, ensuring she's financially secure. But the capital is preserved for the children, who receive it when she dies. Neither party can defeat the other's interest.</p>
  <p>In practice, life interests are usually created through testamentary trusts—trusts established by your will. The trust owns the assets. The life interest holder receives income (and sometimes has rights to use trust property like a house). When they die, the trust assets pass to the remainder beneficiaries.</p>
  <p>Life interests raise several practical questions:</p>
  <p>First, what counts as "income" versus "capital"? Rent from property and dividends from shares are clearly income. But what about capital gains? If the trustee sells shares at a profit, does that belong to the life tenant or the remaindermen? The answer depends on the trust terms and local law.</p>
  <p>Second, who pays for what? The life tenant typically receives income but doesn't pay for capital improvements or major repairs. The remaindermen benefit from capital preservation but don't receive any current benefit. This can create tension when the property needs expensive maintenance—the life tenant might want to defer it (since they don't benefit from maintaining capital), while the remaindermen want it done promptly.</p>
  <p>Third, investment strategy. The trustee must balance the life tenant's need for income against the remaindermen's interest in capital growth. High-income investments might generate good returns for the life tenant but poor capital growth for the remaindermen. Growth investments might build wealth for remaindermen while starving the life tenant of income.</p>
  <p>Fourth, flexibility. Life interests are relatively inflexible. If the life tenant's circumstances change dramatically—maybe they need access to capital for medical care—the trust terms might not allow it. Or if the remaindermen need money urgently, they can't access it until the life tenant dies.</p>
  <p>Modern trusts often include discretionary powers for the trustee to address these issues. The trustee might have authority to pay capital to the life tenant in certain circumstances, or to vary the income/capital split, or even to terminate the life interest early if everyone agrees.</p>
  <p>If you're considering creating a life interest in your will, think carefully about how it will work in practice. What happens if the property needs major repairs? What if the life tenant remarries? What if relationships break down between the life tenant and remaindermen? A good estate planning lawyer will help you address these issues in the trust terms.</p>

<div class="why-matters">
  <h3>💡 Why this matters</h3>
  <p>Life interests balance competing needs—providing income for one person while preserving capital for others. They're common in blended families or when you want to provide for someone without giving them outright ownership. But they create complexity, potential conflicts between life tenant and remaindermen, and inflexibility when circumstances change.</p>
  <p>Consider carefully whether a life interest truly serves your goals or creates more problems than it solves.</p>
