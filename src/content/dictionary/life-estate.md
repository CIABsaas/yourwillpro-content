    <p>**Life estate** (noun) — A property interest that grants someone (the life tenant) the right to use and enjoy property for the duration of their life, after which the property passes to another person (the remainderman). The life tenant has substantial rights to use the property but cannot sell it or leave it to someone else in their will, as their interest automatically ends at death.</p>

    <p>A life estate gives you the right to live in or use a property for as long as you're alive, but you don't fully own it—when you die, it automatically goes to someone else.</p>
    <p>Imagine your mother's will says "I leave my house to my daughter Jane for her life, then to my grandchildren." Jane has a life estate. She can live in the house, rent it out, or otherwise use it for her entire life. But she can't sell it outright (though she can sell her life interest), and she can't leave it to anyone in her will. When Jane dies, the house automatically passes to the grandchildren, regardless of what Jane might have wanted.</p>
    <p>The person with the life estate is called the life tenant. The people who get the property after the life tenant dies are called remaindermen or remainder beneficiaries.</p>
    <p>Life estates are often used in wills to provide for a surviving spouse while ensuring property ultimately goes to children from a previous marriage. Or they might be created to allow an elderly person to continue living in their home while transferring ownership to avoid estate taxes or aged care asset tests.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>Life estates can solve certain estate planning problems, but they create complications that need to be carefully considered.</p>
  <p>The appeal is clear: a life estate lets you provide for one person during their lifetime while guaranteeing the property goes to someone else afterward. The life tenant can't defeat the remaindermen's interest by selling the property or changing their will—the arrangement is locked in.</p>
  <p>But life estates come with significant practical issues:</p>
  <p>First, who pays for what? The life tenant is generally responsible for ordinary maintenance, property taxes, and insurance. But what about major repairs or improvements? If the roof needs replacing, can the life tenant be forced to pay, or do the remaindermen have to contribute since they'll ultimately benefit? These questions often lead to disputes.</p>
  <p>Second, what if the life tenant wants to sell? Technically, they can sell their life interest—but who wants to buy the right to use a property only until an unknown person dies? In practice, any sale requires both the life tenant and the remaindermen to agree and participate. If they can't agree, the property is essentially unsellable.</p>
  <p>Third, what if relationships change? Maybe the life tenant remarries and wants their new spouse to inherit. Too bad—the life estate controls. Or maybe the remaindermen face financial crisis and want to force a sale. The life tenant can block it. The inflexibility that makes life estates attractive for protecting interests also makes them frustrating when circumstances change.</p>
  <p>Fourth, there are tax implications. In some jurisdictions, creating a life estate might trigger capital gains tax or gift tax. And the tax treatment when the property passes to the remaindermen can be complicated.</p>
  <p>Modern estate planning often uses trusts instead of life estates to achieve similar goals with more flexibility. A testamentary trust can give someone the right to live in a property or receive income from it for life, while preserving the capital for others—but with a trustee who can manage the property, deal with maintenance issues, and even sell and replace the property if that's in everyone's best interest.</p>
  <p>If you're considering creating a life estate or if you're a life tenant or remainderman, get legal advice about your specific situation. The rules about rights and responsibilities vary by jurisdiction, and what seems simple on paper can become complex in practice.</p>
