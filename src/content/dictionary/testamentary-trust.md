    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>A trust established through provisions in a will that takes effect upon the testator's death. The trust does not exist during the testator's lifetime and is created only when the will is probated. Commonly used for minor children, beneficiaries with special needs, or asset protection purposes.</p>

    <p>A testamentary trust is a trust you create in your will that springs into existence when you die. During your life, it's just words in your will—the trust doesn't actually exist until after your death when the will goes through probate.</p>

<div class="why-matters">
  <h3>💡 Why this matters</h3>
  <p>Testamentary trusts provide ongoing protection and control over inheritances after you die—crucial for minor children or vulnerable beneficiaries who shouldn't receive large lump sums. Unlike living trusts, they don't require you to transfer assets during your lifetime, making them simpler to set up. But they do require probate before the trust is established.</p>
  <p>Understanding this option helps you protect beneficiaries who need managed support rather than direct inheritance.</p>
</div>

<div class="common-mistakes">
  <h3>⚠️ Common mistakes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Not appointing an appropriate trustee or backup trustee to manage the trust</li>
    <li>Creating overly restrictive trust terms that can't adapt to changing circumstances</li>
    <li>Assuming testamentary trusts avoid probate—they don't, unlike living trusts</li>
    <li>Not coordinating trustee powers with the actual needs of beneficiaries</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="did-you-know">
  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>Testamentary trusts must go through probate since they're created by a will, unlike living trusts which avoid probate. However, testamentary trusts are often simpler and cheaper to establish initially—you only pay for the trust provisions within your will, not a separate trust document.</p>
