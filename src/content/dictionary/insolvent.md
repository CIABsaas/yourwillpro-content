    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>**Insolvent** (adjective) — The state of being unable to pay debts as and when they become due, or having liabilities that exceed assets. In the context of estate administration, an insolvent estate is one where the deceased's debts are greater than the value of their assets, meaning there is insufficient property to pay all creditors in full and nothing left for beneficiaries.</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>Insolvent means you can't pay your debts when they're due—either because you don't have enough assets, or because you can't access the money you need when creditors demand payment.</p>
    <p>For individuals, insolvency often leads to bankruptcy. You owe more than you can pay, and you need a legal process to sort out what happens to your debts and assets.</p>
    <p>When it comes to estates, an insolvent estate is one where the person who died owed more money than they owned. Their debts exceed the value of everything they left behind. In this situation, creditors get paid in a specific order set by law, and beneficiaries named in the will might receive nothing at all—because there's nothing left after the debts are settled.</p>
    <p>This is different from being "broke" or having no money. You could have substantial assets but still be insolvent if those assets can't be converted to cash quickly enough to pay your debts when they're due. And conversely, you might have very little money but not be insolvent if you also have very few debts.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>If you're managing an estate as executor and discover the estate is insolvent, you need to proceed carefully.</p>
  <p>You can't simply pay debts in the order they arrive or according to who's most persistent. There's a statutory order of priority that determines which debts get paid first. Generally, funeral expenses and estate administration costs come first, followed by secured debts (like mortgages), then unsecured debts, and finally any remaining claims. Beneficiaries are last—and in an insolvent estate, they receive nothing.</p>
  <p>As executor, you have a legal duty to pay creditors in the correct order. If you pay the wrong creditors first, or if you distribute assets to beneficiaries before ensuring all debts are covered, you could be personally liable for the shortfall. This is one reason why executors must advertise for creditors and wait the required time before distributing the estate.</p>
  <p>If you think an estate might be insolvent, get legal advice immediately. You might need to apply to the court for directions on how to proceed. And in some cases, it might be appropriate to decline the role of executor altogether—you're not required to take on the responsibility if the estate is hopelessly insolvent and complex.</p>
  <p>For your own estate planning, if you're concerned about dying with debts, remember that most debts die with you—your family won't inherit your credit card debt or personal loans. But secured debts like mortgages stay with the property, so if you want your family to inherit your house, you'll need to ensure they can either pay off or refinance the mortgage.</p>
