    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>A Qualified Terminable Interest Property trust is an irrevocable trust that qualifies for the marital deduction for estate tax purposes while giving the grantor control over ultimate distribution of assets. The surviving spouse receives all income during their lifetime, but the grantor designates who receives the principal after the spouse's death.</p>

    <p>A QTIP trust lets you provide for your spouse after you die while ensuring your assets ultimately go to the people you choose (often children from a first marriage). Your spouse gets all the income from the trust for life, but when they die, the remaining assets go to your chosen beneficiaries, not theirs.</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>QTIP trusts are primarily a U.S. estate planning tool designed for estate tax purposes. Australia doesn't have estate taxes, so QTIP trusts are rarely used here, though similar structures can be created for asset protection or blended family situations.</p>
