    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>A beneficiary named in a will to receive the residue or remainder of an estate after all specific bequests, debts, taxes, and administration expenses have been satisfied. The residuary beneficiary takes what's left over, which may be the bulk of the estate or nothing if debts and expenses consume everything.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column-card plain-column">
    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>The residuary beneficiary gets "everything else" after specific gifts are made and bills are paid. If your will says "I give $10,000 to my friend and the rest to my daughter," your daughter is the residuary beneficiary—she gets whatever remains after that $10,000 and all debts are paid.</p>

  <p>"Dad's will left his watch to my brother, $5,000 to his church, and 'the residue of my estate to my children equally.' As residuary beneficiaries, we three kids split everything else—the house, savings, investments—after those specific gifts and all debts were paid."</p>

      <p>Gets "everything else" that remains. Amount unknown until estate settled. Usually receives the bulk of estate.</p>

    <div class="compare-item">
      <div class="compare-term">Specific Beneficiary</div>
      <p>Gets named items or amounts. Knows exactly what they're receiving. Paid before residuary beneficiaries.</p>

<div class="did-you-know">
  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>Residuary beneficiaries bear the risk of estate shrinkage—if debts and expenses are higher than expected, the residue shrinks or disappears. Specific beneficiaries generally get their gifts first, leaving whatever remains for the residuary beneficiary.</p>
