    <p>**Joint tenancy with right of survivorship** (noun) — A form of property co-ownership where two or more people hold equal, undivided interests in property with the automatic right of surviving co-owners to inherit a deceased co-owner's share. When one joint tenant dies, their interest automatically passes to the surviving joint tenant(s) outside of the deceased's estate, regardless of what their will says. Abbreviated as JTWROS.</p>

    <p>Joint tenancy with right of survivorship is a way of owning property where, if one owner dies, their share automatically goes to the surviving owner(s)—no will needed, no probate required.</p>
    <p>This is different from other ways of co-owning property. If you and your spouse own your house as joint tenants with right of survivorship, when one of you dies, the survivor automatically becomes the sole owner. The deceased's share doesn't go through their estate. It doesn't matter what their will says. It bypasses the whole probate process and passes directly to the survivor.</p>
    <p>The key characteristics are:
- Equal ownership—all joint tenants own equal shares
- Right of survivorship—when one dies, their share goes to the survivors
- Automatic transfer—no need for probate or estate administration
- Unity of interest—created at the same time, in the same document</p>
    <p>This arrangement is common for married couples buying a house together, or for bank accounts held jointly. It ensures that when one person dies, the other continues to have full access to the property immediately.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>Joint tenancy with right of survivorship can be a useful estate planning tool, but it's not always the right choice.</p>
  <p>The main advantage is simplicity. When you die, your share passes automatically to the surviving joint tenant without going through probate. This can save time and money, and it gives the survivor immediate access to the property—particularly important for bank accounts that might be needed to pay bills.</p>
  <p>But there are significant drawbacks to consider:</p>
  <p>First, you lose control. Once you create a joint tenancy, you can't change who gets the property when you die unless all joint tenants agree to sever the joint tenancy. Your will has no effect on joint property—it passes to the survivor regardless of what you intended.</p>
  <p>Second, it can create unintended consequences. If you add someone as a joint tenant to make things "easier" after you die, you're immediately giving them ownership rights. They could force a sale or their creditors could make claims against the property.</p>
  <p>Third, it doesn't work well for blended families. If you and your second spouse own everything jointly with right of survivorship, when you die, everything goes to your spouse. Your children from your first marriage might inherit nothing—even if that's not what you wanted.</p>
  <p>Fourth, it only solves succession for one death. When the last joint tenant dies, the property goes through their estate anyway.</p>
  <p>Before creating a joint tenancy with right of survivorship, think carefully about whether it matches your intentions. For some situations—like a marital home or everyday bank accounts—it works well. But it's not a substitute for a comprehensive estate plan.</p>
