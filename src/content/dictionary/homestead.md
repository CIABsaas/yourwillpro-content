    <p>**Homestead** (noun) — A dwelling and the land immediately surrounding it that serves as a person's primary residence. In legal contexts, particularly in jurisdictions with homestead exemption laws, the term refers to property that may receive special protection from creditors or preferential treatment for tax or estate purposes.</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>Your homestead is your main home—the place where you actually live.</p>
    <p>The term has agricultural and historical roots, originally referring to a family's farm and dwelling. Today it's used more broadly to mean your primary residence, as distinct from investment properties, vacation homes, or other real estate you might own.</p>
    <p>Why does the distinction matter? Because in many legal contexts, your homestead receives different treatment from other property. It might be protected from creditors under homestead exemption laws. It might qualify for tax concessions or exemptions. And when you die, special rules might apply to how it passes to your survivors.</p>
    <p>The key characteristic of a homestead is that it's where you live—not just a property you own. You can only have one homestead at a time, even if you own multiple properties. Generally, it's the place where you spend most of your time and consider your permanent home.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>Understanding what qualifies as your homestead can affect several aspects of estate planning.</p>
  <p>In jurisdictions with homestead exemptions, your primary residence may be protected from creditors—meaning that even if your estate owes debts when you die, creditors might not be able to force the sale of your home to satisfy those debts, or can only claim value above a certain threshold.</p>
  <p>Some jurisdictions also give your homestead special status when it comes to inheritance. There might be rules about a surviving spouse's right to continue living in the homestead, even if the will leaves it to someone else. Or there might be limitations on your ability to give away or mortgage your homestead without your spouse's consent.</p>
  <p>For tax purposes, your homestead may qualify for exemptions or concessions that don't apply to other property. This can affect both property taxes during your lifetime and capital gains or inheritance taxes after death.</p>
  <p>When you're making a will, it's worth understanding these rules and thinking carefully about what happens to your homestead. Do you want your spouse to be able to stay there? Should it be sold and the proceeds divided? The answers may be influenced by the legal protections and obligations that already apply to homestead property in your jurisdiction.</p>
