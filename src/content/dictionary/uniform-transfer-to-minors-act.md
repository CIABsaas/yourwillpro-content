    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>A uniform state law providing a statutory framework for transferring property to minors through a custodian, who manages the property until the minor reaches a specified age (typically 18-25, depending on state). UTMA allows simpler transfers than formal trusts, covering various property types including securities, real estate, and tangible property.</p>

    <p>UTMA (often pronounced "UT-ma") lets you give property to kids through an adult custodian who manages it until the child reaches adulthood (age varies by state). It's simpler than creating a trust but less flexible—the child gets everything at the set age.</p>

  <p>"Grandma left $50,000 to my daughter 'under UTMA' with me as custodian. I manage and invest the money for her benefit until she turns 21 (our state's UTMA age), then she gets it all outright whether she's ready for it or not."</p>

      <p>Simple, statutory framework. Ends at specific age. No flexibility. Child gets everything automatically.</p>

      <p>Custom terms possible. Can extend beyond age 18-25. Flexible distributions. More control, higher costs.</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>UTMA's main limitation is inflexibility—when the child reaches the termination age, they get everything, period. If you're worried about an 18- or 21-year-old getting $100,000 all at once, a trust with gradual distributions might be better than UTMA.</p>
