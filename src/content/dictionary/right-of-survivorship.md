    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>A characteristic of joint tenancy whereby, upon the death of one joint tenant, that person's interest in the property automatically passes to the surviving joint tenant(s) by operation of law, outside of probate and regardless of will provisions. The right of survivorship takes precedence over testamentary dispositions.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column-card plain-column">
    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>Right of survivorship means when one owner of jointly-held property dies, the survivor automatically becomes the sole owner. It doesn't matter what the deceased person's will says—the property goes directly to the surviving joint owner, bypassing probate entirely.</p>

<div class="why-matters">
  <h3>💡 Why this matters</h3>
  <p>Right of survivorship overrides your will completely. Many people add joint owners to property for convenience without realizing this means those assets will bypass their will and go directly to the surviving owner—potentially disinheriting children or other intended beneficiaries.</p>
  <p>Understanding right of survivorship helps you use it intentionally rather than accidentally changing who inherits.</p>
</div>

<div class="common-mistakes">
  <h3>⚠️ Common mistakes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Adding someone to property title for convenience without realizing you're giving them automatic inheritance rights</li>
    <li>Assuming your will controls jointly-owned property—right of survivorship takes precedence</li>
    <li>In blended families, using joint tenancy that accidentally disinherits children from first marriages</li>
    <li>Not understanding that the last surviving joint owner's will controls final distribution, which may not match your wishes</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="did-you-know">
  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>Right of survivorship can create problems in blended families—if you add a new spouse to your house title as a joint tenant, your children from a previous marriage won't inherit that property when you die, even if your will says they should.</p>
