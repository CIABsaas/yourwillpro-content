    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>**Advance Directive** (noun) — A legal document stating your preferences for medical treatment in situations where you cannot communicate or make decisions for yourself.</p>
  </div>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>An advance directive lets you document what kinds of medical treatment you would or wouldn't want if you become unconscious, severely ill, or otherwise unable to express your wishes. It's your voice when you can't speak for yourself.</p>
    <p>These documents typically cover decisions like whether you'd want life support, artificial feeding, resuscitation, or specific treatments in end-of-life scenarios. You create them while you're well and capable, so your preferences are clear if that changes.</p>
    <p>Different places use different names for these documents, but the purpose is the same: ensuring medical professionals and your family know what you'd want done. It removes the burden of guessing and helps avoid conflicts during already difficult times.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>You'll encounter advance directives in hospitals, aged care facilities, and doctors' offices. Many people create them when planning their estate, alongside their will and power of attorney documents. Medical professionals increasingly ask patients whether they have one on file.</p>
  <p>The document becomes active only when you're unable to make or communicate decisions yourself. Until then, you remain in control of all your medical choices. You can change or cancel an advance directive at any time while you're still capable.</p>
  <p>Without an advance directive, medical decisions fall to your next of kin or whoever has power of attorney for healthcare. They'll need to make difficult choices without clear guidance from you. Having your wishes documented in advance provides clarity and reduces stress for everyone involved during medical crises.</p>
