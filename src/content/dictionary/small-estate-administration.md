    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>A streamlined probate procedure available for estates valued below a jurisdiction-specific threshold, typically allowing estate administration through affidavit or simplified petition without full formal probate proceedings. The process reduces time, costs, and court involvement while still providing legal authority to distribute estate assets.</p>

    <p>Small estate administration is a faster, cheaper way to handle small estates without going through full probate. If the estate is under a certain dollar amount (varies by state—often $50,000 to $150,000), you can use a simple affidavit or short court process instead of formal probate, saving months of time and thousands in fees.</p>

  <p>"When Aunt Mary died, her estate was only worth $45,000—just a car and a small savings account. Because it was under our state's $75,000 threshold, we used small estate administration. We filed a simple affidavit, waited 30 days, and were able to distribute everything without formal probate."</p>
