    <p>**Conditional Bequest** (noun) — A gift in a will that only takes effect if specified conditions are met, with alternative provisions if the conditions are not satisfied.</p>

    <p>A conditional bequest is a gift in your will that comes with strings attached. The beneficiary only receives it if they meet certain conditions. If they don't, the gift either goes to someone else or back into the estate.</p>
    <p>Common conditions include surviving you by a certain time, reaching a specific age, completing education, remaining unmarried, or continuing to practice a particular religion. The condition must be legal—you can't require someone to do something illegal or unconscionable to inherit.</p>
    <p>Courts scrutinize conditional bequests carefully. Conditions that restrain marriage, promote divorce, or require illegal acts are typically void. Conditions must be clear, possible to fulfill, and not against public policy.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>People use conditional bequests for various reasons: encouraging education ("$50,000 if she completes university"), protecting young beneficiaries ("nothing until age 25"), or ensuring gifts stay in the family ("only if still married to my son"). They're also used to give gifts to minors in stages.</p>
  <p>Problems arise when conditions are unclear or become impossible to fulfill. If you leave money "if my grandson becomes a doctor" but he dies in an accident during medical school, courts must interpret whether he substantially met the condition or the gift fails.</p>
  <p>You'll encounter conditional bequests in many wills, particularly those involving young beneficiaries or people wanting to influence behavior after death. They require careful drafting to be enforceable. The testator must balance their wishes with reasonable limits on control after death. Overly restrictive conditions might be deemed void, defeating the entire purpose.</p>
