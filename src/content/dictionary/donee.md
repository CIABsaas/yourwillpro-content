    <p>**Donee** (noun) — The person who receives a gift, benefit, or power from another person (the donor), particularly in the context of powers of attorney or transfers of property.</p>

    <p>A donee is simply the person who receives something. The term is most commonly used in two contexts: when someone receives a gift of property, and when someone is given legal authority under a power of attorney.</p>
    <p>When you give someone power of attorney, they become your donee, meaning they're the person who receives the power to act on your behalf. You're the donor (the person giving the power), and they're the donee (the person receiving it). This terminology can sound confusing because we often call them your "attorney" or "agent," but legally they're the donee of the power.</p>
    <p>In gift situations, if you give money or property to someone, they're the donee of that gift. This becomes relevant for estate planning when tracking gifts you've made during your lifetime, as some jurisdictions consider large gifts when calculating estate taxes or assessing claims against your estate.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>You'll encounter the term donee most often in power of attorney documents. The document might say "the donee of this power shall have authority to..." meaning the person you've appointed has that authority. Understanding this terminology helps you read and comprehend these legal documents.</p>
  <p>The relationship between donor and donee creates certain legal obligations. A donee under a power of attorney must act in the donor's best interests and follow their wishes. They're not receiving the power as a gift to use for themselves, but as a responsibility to help the donor manage their affairs.</p>
  <p>For completed gifts, the donee receives the property outright and can generally do whatever they wish with it. However, if someone made you the donee of a gift shortly before they died, that gift might be scrutinized to ensure it was made properly and not under undue influence. Large gifts to donees can also be relevant if someone challenges the estate for inadequate provision.</p>
