    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>**Estate** (noun) — The total collection of assets, property, rights, and obligations that a person owns or owes at the time of their death, which becomes subject to administration and distribution according to their will or intestacy laws.</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>Your estate is everything you own at the moment you die. This includes obvious things like your house, car, and bank accounts, but also less obvious assets like superannuation, life insurance, shares, business interests, personal belongings, and even money people owe you.</p>
    <p>Your estate also includes your debts and obligations. When someone dies, their debts don't disappear. The estate is responsible for paying these debts before distributing anything to beneficiaries. This is why you might hear people say an estate is "solvent" (has enough assets to pay all debts) or "insolvent" (doesn't have enough to cover its debts).</p>
    <p>Some things you "own" don't actually form part of your estate. Property you own as a joint tenant automatically passes to the surviving owner and doesn't go through your estate. Similarly, life insurance with a named beneficiary and superannuation usually pass directly to beneficiaries outside your estate. Understanding what's in your estate versus what passes outside it is important for estate planning.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>When someone dies, their estate needs to be administered. This means collecting all the assets, paying all the debts and taxes, and then distributing what's left according to the will or intestacy laws. The person who handles this process (the executor or administrator) is managing "the estate."</p>
  <p>The size and complexity of an estate can vary enormously. One person's estate might be a simple bank account and household furniture. Another person's estate might include multiple properties, business interests, investment portfolios, and complex arrangements. More complex estates take longer to administer and might require professional help.</p>
  <p>Estate planning is essentially planning what happens to your estate after you die. Through a will, you specify who receives what from your estate. Through other strategies like joint ownership or trusts, you might arrange for some assets to pass outside your estate. Good estate planning considers both what's in your estate and what passes outside it to ensure your overall wishes are fulfilled.</p>

  <p>"Dad's estate included his house worth $600k, $150k in bank accounts, $80k in shares, and his car. After paying $15k in debts and $35k in executor costs, the estate distributed $780k to us three kids."</p>

<div class="why-matters">
  <h3>💡 Why this matters</h3>
  <p>Understanding what's in your estate versus what passes outside it determines whether your will actually controls those assets. Many people are surprised to learn that their largest assets—like superannuation or jointly-owned property—might not be governed by their will at all.</p>
  <p>Effective estate planning requires knowing what your estate includes and planning for assets both inside and outside it.</p>

<div class="common-mistakes">
  <h3>⚠️ Common mistakes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Assuming your will controls all your assets—some pass outside the estate</li>
    <li>Not realizing jointly-owned property doesn't form part of your estate</li>
    <li>Forgetting about debts when estimating what beneficiaries will receive</li>
    <li>Overlooking that estate administration costs reduce what's left to distribute</li>
  </ul>
