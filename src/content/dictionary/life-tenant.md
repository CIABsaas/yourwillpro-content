    <p>**Life tenant** (noun) — A person who holds a life estate or life interest in property, giving them the right to possess, use, and enjoy the property during their lifetime, after which the property passes to other beneficiaries (the remaindermen). The life tenant has substantial rights but does not own the property outright and cannot pass it to heirs through a will.</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>A life tenant is someone who has the right to use property for as long as they live, but doesn't own it permanently.</p>
    <p>If your father's will leaves the family home "to my wife for her life, then to my children," your stepmother is the life tenant. She can live in the house for the rest of her life. When she dies, the house passes to you and your siblings (the remaindermen)—she can't leave it to anyone else in her will because her rights end when she dies.</p>
    <p>Being a life tenant comes with both rights and responsibilities. On the rights side, you can live in the property, rent it out, or otherwise use it to generate income. You're entitled to keep any income the property produces. On the responsibility side, you must maintain the property, pay property taxes and insurance, and avoid damaging or depleting the asset (called "waste" in legal terms).</p>
    <p>Life tenants are common in estate planning situations involving blended families. A person wants to ensure their surviving spouse can continue living in the family home, but also wants to guarantee the property ultimately goes to their own children.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>Being a life tenant puts you in an interesting but sometimes difficult position—you have significant rights, but they come with limitations and obligations.</p>
  <p>Your main rights as a life tenant:
- You can possess and use the property
- You're entitled to any income it generates (like rent)
- You can sell or mortgage your life interest (though finding a buyer is difficult since the interest ends when you die)
- You can exclude the remaindermen from the property during your lifetime</p>
  <p>Your main responsibilities:
- Pay property taxes, insurance, and ordinary maintenance costs
- Keep the property in reasonable repair
- Avoid "waste"—acts that substantially reduce the property's value
- Not make major changes to the property without permission</p>
  <p>The relationship between life tenants and remaindermen often creates friction. You benefit from the property now; they benefit later. This misalignment of interests can cause disputes about who pays for what.</p>
  <p>For example, the roof needs replacing. It's a major capital expense that will benefit the remaindermen more than you—they'll own the property for decades after you die, while you'll only benefit from the new roof for your remaining years. But as life tenant, you might be expected to pay for it, or at least contribute.</p>
  <p>Or imagine you want to cut down mature trees to create better views. The remaindermen object because the trees add value to the property. As life tenant, you can't substantially alter the property in ways that reduce its value for the remaindermen.</p>
  <p>If you want to sell the property—perhaps to move into a care facility—you generally need the remaindermen to agree and participate in the sale. They own the future interest, so any buyer needs them to release their rights. If the remaindermen refuse, you're stuck. You can sell your life interest, but who wants to buy a property interest that ends on your death?</p>
  <p>Some life estates are created through trusts rather than direct ownership, which can provide more flexibility. A trust might give the trustee power to sell property and reinvest the proceeds, or to pay capital to the life tenant in certain circumstances. This can help address the inflexibility problems that plague traditional life estates.</p>
  <p>If you're a life tenant and having difficulties with remaindermen or questions about your rights and responsibilities, seek legal advice specific to your jurisdiction. The rules vary, and the specific language creating the life estate matters.</p>
