    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>**Domicile** (noun) — A person's permanent legal residence and the place they intend to return to, which determines which jurisdiction's laws apply to their estate, taxation, and legal affairs.</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>Your domicile is your permanent legal home, the place you consider your real base even if you're temporarily living somewhere else. It's different from simply where you're currently living. You can have many residences, but you only have one domicile.</p>
    <p>Domicile matters because it determines which country's or state's laws apply to your estate when you die. If you're domiciled in New South Wales, for example, NSW laws will govern how your estate is distributed, even if you own property in other places. Your domicile also affects which taxes you pay and which courts have jurisdiction over your affairs.</p>
    <p>Changing your domicile isn't as simple as moving houses. You need to physically move to a new place and genuinely intend to make it your permanent home. Courts look at many factors, including where you vote, where your bank accounts are, where your family lives, and where you plan to be buried. Simply buying a holiday home somewhere doesn't change your domicile.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>Domicile becomes important when dealing with international estates or when someone has lived in multiple places. Lawyers need to determine domicile to know which jurisdiction's laws apply to the estate. This affects everything from how the will is interpreted to which taxes are payable.</p>
  <p>For people who have moved countries or who split their time between multiple locations, domicile can be complex to establish. Someone might live in Australia for part of the year but still be domiciled in the UK if they intend to eventually return there. This intention is the key factor, and it's often established through evidence of ongoing ties and future plans.</p>
  <p>Disputes about domicile can delay estate administration and create tax complications. If you've moved permanently to a new country or state, it's wise to establish clear evidence of your new domicile through actions like updating your will, changing your driver's license, registering to vote, and documenting your intention to make the new place your permanent home.</p>
