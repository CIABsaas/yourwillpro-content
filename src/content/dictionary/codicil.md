    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>**Codicil** (noun) — A legal document that amends, rather than replaces, an existing will, used to make specific changes without rewriting the entire will.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column-card plain-column">
    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>A codicil is an addition or amendment to your will. Instead of creating an entirely new will, you create a separate document that says "here are the changes to my existing will." The original will and the codicil are read together.</p>
    <p>Codicils are useful for small changes—updating an executor, changing a specific gift, adding a beneficiary. They let you adjust your will without the expense and effort of drafting a completely new document. The codicil must be executed with the same formalities as a will (signed, witnessed).</p>
    <p>Many modern lawyers prefer creating a new will rather than using codicils. It's clearer, prevents confusion about which version applies, and often isn't significantly more work with computerized documents. Multiple codicils can create confusion about what your current wishes actually are.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>You'll encounter codicils in older estates where people made multiple adjustments over years. Someone might have a will from 1985 with codicils from 1992, 1998, and 2005, each changing different aspects. Sorting out the cumulative effect requires reading all documents together.</p>
  <p>Codicils must meet all formalities required for wills. An informal note saying "I've changed my mind about who gets the car" isn't a valid codicil—it needs proper execution. If the codicil fails these requirements, the original will stands unchanged.</p>
  <p>When you find a will with codicils during estate administration, you must prove all of them. Each codicil goes through probate along with the original will. Missing even one codicil means the will might not reflect the deceased's final wishes. This is why many people now simply execute new wills rather than creating a trail of codicils.</p>

  <p>"Dad made his will in 2010, then added a codicil in 2015 changing his executor from his old friend to his daughter. Both documents were submitted for probate together."</p>

<div class="why-matters">
  <h3>💡 Why this matters</h3>
  <p>Multiple codicils create confusion and increase the risk of disputes. Each codicil must be found, proven, and interpreted alongside the original will—missing one can mean the estate doesn't reflect the deceased's final wishes. Modern practice favors creating a new will instead, which is clearer and simpler.</p>
  <p>If you're considering a codicil, ask whether a new will would be more appropriate.</p>
