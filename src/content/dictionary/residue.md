    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>The property remaining in an estate after all specific devises and bequests, debts, taxes, and administration expenses have been satisfied. Synonymous with residuary estate or remainder. Commonly referenced in wills with phrases like "rest, residue, and remainder of my estate."</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>Residue simply means "what's left over." When lawyers write wills, they often use the formal phrase "rest, residue, and remainder" to mean the same thing: everything that's left after specific gifts are made and bills are paid. It's just another word for the residuary estate.</p>

    <div class="compare-item">
      <div class="compare-term">Residue</div>
      <p>The leftover—amount unknown until estate settled. Catches all unspecified assets. Flexible, adjusts to estate size.</p>

    <div class="compare-item">
      <div class="compare-term">Specific Gift</div>
      <p>Particular item or stated amount. Recipient knows exactly what to expect. Fixed, doesn't adjust based on estate value.</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>The traditional legal phrase "rest, residue, and remainder" is actually redundant—all three words mean essentially the same thing. Lawyers use all three for historical reasons and to be absolutely certain they've covered everything, even though "residue" alone would suffice.</p>
