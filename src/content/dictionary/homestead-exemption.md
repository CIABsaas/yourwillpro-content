    <p>**Homestead exemption** (noun) — A legal provision that protects a portion or all of the value of a person's primary residence from creditors, forced sale, or certain taxes. The scope and application of homestead exemptions vary significantly by jurisdiction, with some offering extensive protection and others providing limited or no exemption.</p>

    <p>A homestead exemption protects your home from being seized to pay debts—up to a certain value.</p>
    <p>The idea is that everyone deserves to keep a roof over their head, even if they're facing financial trouble. In jurisdictions that have homestead exemptions, creditors generally can't force you to sell your primary residence to pay debts, or can only claim the value above the exemption threshold.</p>
    <p>The protection varies widely. In some places, homestead exemptions are generous—protecting hundreds of thousands of dollars in home equity, or even the entire value of the property. In others, the protection is minimal or doesn't exist at all. And the rules about what qualifies as a homestead, who can claim the exemption, and what types of debts it protects against are all different depending on where you live.</p>
    <p>Homestead exemptions are most commonly associated with the United States, where they're an important part of bankruptcy and debt collection law. In Australia and the UK, similar protections exist but work differently and are called by different names.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>Understanding homestead exemptions matters if you're dealing with estate planning, bankruptcy, or debt collection—though the relevance depends heavily on your jurisdiction.</p>
  <p>In places with strong homestead protections, the exemption can affect how your estate is administered after death. If your estate owes debts, creditors might not be able to touch the value of your home that's covered by the exemption, meaning more passes to your beneficiaries.</p>
  <p>Homestead exemptions can also influence decisions about how you hold property. In some jurisdictions, you might need to formally declare a homestead to claim the protection. In others, it applies automatically to your primary residence.</p>
  <p>If you're in the United States, homestead exemption laws can be particularly important in estate planning, especially if you're concerned about creditor claims or Medicaid recovery. In Australia, the concept is less central but related protections exist under bankruptcy law and in some state-specific provisions.</p>
  <p>In the UK, homestead exemptions don't exist in the same form, though there are other protections for primary residences in certain circumstances—such as rules about when a trustee in bankruptcy can force the sale of a family home.</p>
