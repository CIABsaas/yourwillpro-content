    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>A will declared orally (spoken aloud) rather than written down. Also called a nuncupative will or deathbed will. Generally invalid in most modern jurisdictions. Where still permitted in extremely limited circumstances (military personnel, mariners at sea, imminent death), typically requires multiple witnesses, can only dispose of personal property, and must meet strict requirements rarely satisfied.</p>

    <p>A spoken will—you declare your wishes out loud instead of writing them down. The same as a nuncupative will. In almost all modern jurisdictions, oral wills are invalid. The law requires written, signed, witnessed wills because written documents are reliable. Spoken words are unreliable—witnesses forget, disagree, or lie. Even in the handful of jurisdictions that allow oral wills in limited circumstances, successful probate is extraordinarily rare.</p>

  <p>"My uncle's caregiver claimed he made an oral will leaving her his house. The court ruled it invalid. In our state, wills must be in writing and properly witnessed. The house went to his children under intestacy rules."</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>Recording a video of someone declaring their wishes doesn't make it a valid will in most jurisdictions. The video might be evidence of intentions, but without a written, signed, witnessed document, it's not a legal will. Make a written will—don't count on oral declarations being recognized.</p>
