    <p>**Dower** (noun) — A historical common law right that entitled a widow to a life interest in a portion (typically one-third) of her deceased husband's real estate, regardless of what his will specified.</p>

    <p>Dower was an old legal protection that gave widows the right to inherit part of their husband's property, even if the husband's will tried to leave everything to someone else. Under traditional dower rights, a wife was automatically entitled to use about one-third of her husband's land for the rest of her life.</p>
    <p>This concept dates back centuries to when married women couldn't own property themselves and depended entirely on their husbands for financial support. Dower rights ensured that a widow wouldn't be left destitute if her husband died and tried to leave all his property to others.</p>
    <p>In most modern jurisdictions, dower rights have been abolished and replaced with more contemporary spousal protection laws. These modern protections typically give spouses the right to challenge a will if they've been left inadequate provision, rather than automatically entitling them to a specific portion of the estate.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>You'll rarely encounter actual dower rights in modern estate planning, as they've been eliminated in most places. However, the term occasionally appears in old property titles or historical legal documents. Some older property deeds might reference "dower rights" that were released or waived when the property was previously transferred.</p>
  <p>The concept behind dower, protecting surviving spouses from disinheritance, continues in modern law through different mechanisms. Most jurisdictions now have family provision laws or forced heirship rules that serve a similar purpose. These allow spouses (and sometimes other dependents) to claim against an estate if the deceased didn't make adequate provision for them.</p>
  <p>Understanding dower helps explain why modern law gives spouses certain protected inheritance rights. The principle that you can't completely disinherit your spouse without good reason stems from the same concern that created dower rights: ensuring that people who depended on the deceased aren't left without support.</p>
