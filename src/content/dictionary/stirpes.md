    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>Derived from Latin "per stirpes" meaning "by roots" or "by branch," this is a method of distributing an estate where deceased beneficiaries' descendants take their ancestor's share. The estate divides into shares at the first generational level, with each deceased person's descendants splitting that branch's portion equally.</p>

    <p>Distribution "by stirpes" means dividing an estate by family branches. If a will leaves everything to three children "per stirpes" and one child predeceases, that deceased child's children (the grandchildren) split their parent's one-third share. Each branch gets an equal portion.</p>
