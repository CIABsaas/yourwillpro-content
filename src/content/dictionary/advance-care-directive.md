    <p>An advance care directive lets you document what medical treatments you would or wouldn't want if you become unable to communicate your wishes. This might cover scenarios like permanent unconsciousness, terminal illness, or advanced dementia.</p>
    <p>You can specify preferences about life support, resuscitation, pain management, and other medical interventions. You might also name a substitute decision-maker to interpret your wishes and make decisions on your behalf.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>This document is separate from your will—it operates during your life, not after death. Each Australian state and territory has different names and rules for these documents: Advance Care Directive (SA, NT), Advance Care Plan (Vic, Tas), Advance Health Directive (Qld), Advance Care Planning (NSW, ACT), or Advance Health Directive (WA).</p>
  <p>Medical professionals must consider your directive, but in emergencies where your directive isn't immediately available or clear, they'll act in your best medical interests. Having conversations with your doctor and family about your directive helps ensure your wishes are understood and respected.</p>
