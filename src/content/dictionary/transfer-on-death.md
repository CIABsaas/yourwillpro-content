    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>A beneficiary designation mechanism that allows property—typically real estate, vehicles, or securities—to transfer automatically to a named beneficiary upon the owner's death without going through probate. The owner retains full control during life and can revoke or change the designation at any time.</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>Transfer on death (TOD) lets you name someone to automatically inherit your property when you die—no probate needed. You keep total control while alive and can change your mind anytime. When you die, the beneficiary just shows a death certificate to claim it.</p>

    <div class="compare-item">
      <div class="compare-term">Transfer on Death</div>
      <p>Sole ownership during life. Beneficiary gets nothing until death. Fully revocable. Complete control retained.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="compare-item">
      <div class="compare-term">Joint Tenancy</div>
      <p>Shared ownership immediately. Co-owner has current rights. Harder to revoke. Control shared.</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>Transfer-on-death mechanisms aren't available for all property types in all jurisdictions. While bank accounts and securities widely support TOD, real estate TOD deeds are only valid in certain states and countries. Always check local laws before relying on TOD for estate planning.</p>
