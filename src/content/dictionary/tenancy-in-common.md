    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>A form of concurrent property ownership where two or more persons each own separate, undivided fractional interests in property. Each tenant in common can transfer their share independently, and upon death, their share passes to their estate or beneficiaries—not to the other co-owners.</p>
  </div>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>Tenancy in common means you own a percentage of something with other people. You can sell your share without permission from the others, and when you die, your share goes to your heirs in your will—not automatically to the co-owners.</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>Tenancy in common is the default form of co-ownership in many jurisdictions when the deed doesn't specify otherwise. Unlike joint tenancy, tenants in common can own unequal shares—like one person owning 70% and another 30%—making it flexible for unequal investments.</p>
