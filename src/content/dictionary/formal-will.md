    <p>**Formal Will** (noun) — A will that complies with all statutory formalities required for execution, typically including being in writing, signed by the testator in the presence of two or more witnesses, and signed by those witnesses, thereby creating a presumption of validity.</p>

    <p>A formal will is a will that's been properly prepared and signed according to all the legal requirements. It's in writing, it's signed by you (the testator), and it's witnessed by at least two people who also sign it in your presence. Meeting these formal requirements makes the will legally valid and enforceable.</p>
    <p>The formalities exist to ensure the will is genuine, that you made it voluntarily, and that it represents your actual wishes. Having witnesses present when you sign prevents someone from forging your signature after you die. Having you and the witnesses all present together and signing in a specific sequence creates a formal ceremony that emphasizes the document's importance.</p>
    <p>A formal will is different from informal will types like holographic wills (entirely handwritten by the testator) or oral wills, which some jurisdictions allow in limited circumstances. Formal wills are the standard, most reliable type, and they're valid in all jurisdictions that recognize wills.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>When you work with a solicitor or professional will service to prepare your will, you'll create a formal will. They'll guide you through the signing process to ensure all formalities are met. This typically involves gathering at least two witnesses, explaining what everyone needs to do, and following the proper sequence of signing.</p>
  <p>The formal requirements vary slightly by jurisdiction, but the core elements are consistent: written document, testator signature, and witness signatures. Some jurisdictions require three witnesses; most require two. Some jurisdictions require witnesses to sign in each other's presence; others don't. Your solicitor or will provider will ensure compliance with your jurisdiction's specific requirements.</p>
  <p>Failing to meet the formal requirements can invalidate your will. If witnesses didn't actually see you sign, or if they're beneficiaries under the will (which disqualifies them in most jurisdictions), the will might be invalid or partially invalid. This is why taking the formalities seriously and following proper procedures is crucial. A formal will that's properly executed creates strong legal presumption of validity and is much harder to challenge than an informal will.</p>
