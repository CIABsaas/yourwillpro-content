    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>All property, assets, and interests legally transferred to and held by a trust, owned by the trustee in their fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the trust's beneficiaries. Trust property can include real estate, financial accounts, securities, business interests, intellectual property, or any other transferable asset.</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>Trust property is everything actually owned by the trust—your house if you transferred it in, your investments if they're titled to the trust, any property formally moved into the trust's name. If it's not been transferred to the trust, it's not trust property.</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>Creating a trust without transferring property into it is like buying a safe but leaving your valuables on the kitchen table. The trust exists but accomplishes nothing. Properly "funding" the trust—actually transferring title of your assets to it—is essential for the trust to work.</p>
