    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>The judicial procedure by which a will is proved valid or invalid, an executor or administrator is appointed, estate assets are inventoried and valued, debts and taxes are paid, and remaining assets are distributed to beneficiaries or heirs. The process provides court supervision to ensure proper estate administration.</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>The probate process is all the steps you have to go through with the court to wrap up someone's estate after they die. You file the will, prove it's valid, get appointed as executor, collect and value all the assets, pay bills and taxes, and then distribute what's left to beneficiaries. It typically takes 6-18 months depending on the estate's complexity.</p>
