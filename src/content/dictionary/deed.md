    <p>**Deed** (noun) — A legal document that transfers ownership of real property from one party to another, executed with required formalities and typically recorded in public records.</p>

    <p>A deed is the official document that transfers ownership of land or buildings from one person to another. When you buy or inherit real estate, a deed is what makes the transfer legally binding and puts your name on the property as the new owner.</p>
    <p>Deeds must meet specific legal requirements to be valid. They need proper descriptions of the property, signatures from the person transferring ownership, witnesses in many jurisdictions, and sometimes notarization. Once signed, deeds are typically recorded with the local land registry or recorder's office to provide public notice of the ownership change.</p>
    <p>Different types of deeds offer different levels of protection to the buyer. A warranty deed guarantees clear title. A quitclaim deed transfers whatever interest the seller has without any guarantees. The type of deed matters significantly for the new owner's protection.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>In estate administration, executors use deeds to transfer real property from the deceased to beneficiaries. The executor signs a deed conveying the property from "the estate of [deceased's name]" to the beneficiary. This legally moves ownership and allows the beneficiary to sell, mortgage, or otherwise use the property.</p>
  <p>Recording the deed is essential. Until it's recorded in public records, the transfer isn't complete and the new owner's interest isn't protected against other claims. Most jurisdictions require recording before the new owner can sell or mortgage the property.</p>
  <p>You'll encounter deeds when inheriting property, buying real estate, or transferring property as part of estate planning. Understanding what type of deed you're receiving and ensuring it's properly recorded are crucial for protecting your ownership rights.</p>
