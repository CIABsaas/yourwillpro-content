    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>Everything you own except land and buildings. All the movable stuff—your car, furniture, clothes, jewelry, collectibles, money in the bank, shares, and digital assets. Divided into tangible (physical things you can touch) and intangible (financial assets, rights, digital property). Unlike real estate which requires specific transfer documents, personal property can usually be given away more simply in a will.</p>
