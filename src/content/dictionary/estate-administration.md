    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>**Estate Administration** (noun) — The legal process of collecting a deceased person's assets, paying their debts and taxes, and distributing the remaining property to beneficiaries according to the will or intestacy laws, managed by an executor or administrator.</p>

    <p>Estate administration is the entire process of wrapping up someone's affairs after they die. It involves locating all their assets, paying everything they owed, and giving what's left to the people who are supposed to receive it. The executor named in the will, or an administrator if there's no will, manages this process.</p>
    <p>The process typically follows a sequence. First, the executor applies for probate (or letters of administration if there's no will). Then they locate and secure all assets, notify banks and government agencies, pay debts and taxes, and finally distribute what remains to the beneficiaries. For a simple estate, this might take six months. For complex estates, it can take years.</p>
    <p>During administration, the estate is like a temporary entity. It has its own tax obligations, its own bank account, and its own responsibilities. The executor manages everything on behalf of the estate, keeping careful records of all transactions. They're personally responsible for getting this right, which is why executors need to be thorough and careful.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>Estate administration begins after someone dies and ends when all assets have been distributed and the estate is closed. The complexity varies significantly depending on what the deceased owned, whether there are disputes, and whether tax issues need resolution.</p>
  <p>Common tasks during administration include obtaining the death certificate, securing property and valuable items, valuing assets, opening an estate bank account, notifying creditors, preparing tax returns, selling assets if necessary, and maintaining detailed records of all transactions. The executor must keep beneficiaries informed about progress and address any concerns that arise.</p>
  <p>Mistakes in estate administration can result in personal liability for the executor, disputes among beneficiaries, or delays in distribution. This is why many executors work with solicitors or professional estate administrators, particularly for larger or more complex estates. The estate pays for professional help, so getting assistance doesn't necessarily cost executors personally.</p>
