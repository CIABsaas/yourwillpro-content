    <p>Trust assets are the stuff actually owned by the trust—your house, investments, bank accounts, whatever you've transferred into the trust. If it hasn't been transferred into the trust, it's not a trust asset, even if your trust document mentions it.</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>One of the most common estate planning mistakes is creating a trust but never funding it—not transferring assets into it. An unfunded trust is like an empty bucket—it exists but doesn't accomplish anything because there are no trust assets for it to protect or manage.</p>
