    <p>**Intestate** (adjective or noun) — 1. (adjective) The state of dying without having made a valid will, or with a will that fails to dispose of all property. 2. (noun) A person who has died without leaving a valid will. When someone dies intestate, their estate is distributed according to the statutory rules of intestate succession rather than according to their expressed wishes.</p>

    <p>If you die intestate, it means you died without a valid will.</p>
    <p>Maybe you never got around to making one. Maybe you made a will but it was invalid—perhaps it wasn't properly signed or witnessed, or you lacked capacity when you made it. Or maybe your will is valid but it doesn't cover everything you own, making you partially intestate for the property that's not dealt with.</p>
    <p>When someone dies intestate, the law decides who inherits. There's a fixed order set out in legislation: typically your spouse or partner first, then children, then parents, then siblings, and so on. The exact rules vary by jurisdiction, but everywhere has some version of this hierarchy.</p>
    <p>Dying intestate doesn't mean your estate is in chaos or that the government automatically takes everything. Your property still goes to your family—just according to a formula the law has decided, not according to what you might have wanted.</p>
    <p>But that formula might not match your intentions. It might give property to people you're estranged from and nothing to people you care about. It might not account for who needs the money most, or who's been helping you, or any special circumstances in your family.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>Being intestate creates practical and emotional complications for the people you leave behind.</p>
  <p>When you die intestate, someone has to apply to the court for letters of administration to get legal authority to deal with your estate. This is similar to probate but typically more complicated—there's no executor appointed, no clear statement of your wishes, and sometimes uncertainty about who the rightful heirs are.</p>
  <p>The person who applies to be administrator is usually determined by the intestacy laws—generally, whoever is entitled to the largest share of the estate has priority. This might not be the person you would have chosen, or the person best suited to the role.</p>
  <p>Dying intestate also removes your ability to:
- Choose who gets what and in what proportions
- Leave anything to people outside the legal hierarchy (like friends, step-children, or charities)
- Appoint guardians for your minor children
- Set up trusts for beneficiaries who might need managed support
- Name an executor you trust to handle your affairs
- Express your wishes about funeral arrangements or other personal matters</p>
  <p>The simplest way to avoid dying intestate is to make a will. Even a basic will gives you control and makes things easier for your family. And if your circumstances change, you can update it.</p>

<div class="why-matters">
  <h3>💡 Why this matters</h3>
  <p>Dying intestate means the law—not you—decides who gets your assets. This can lead to outcomes you never intended: estranged family members inheriting while close friends or step-children get nothing. It also delays estate settlement, increases costs, and can cause family conflict over who should administer the estate.</p>
  <p>Even a simple will gives you control and makes things easier for the people you care about.</p>

<div class="common-mistakes">
  <h3>⚠️ Common mistakes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Thinking "I don't have enough assets to need a will"—intestacy laws apply to estates of any size</li>
    <li>Assuming your spouse automatically gets everything—in most jurisdictions, they share with children or other relatives</li>
    <li>Believing intestacy only affects assets—it also means you can't appoint guardians for minor children</li>
    <li>Putting off making a will because you think you have time—accidents and unexpected illness happen</li>
  </ul>
