    <p>**Estate Tax Return** (noun) — A formal tax filing submitted to tax authorities that reports the total value of a deceased person's estate, claims applicable deductions and exemptions, and calculates any estate tax due, required when an estate exceeds certain value thresholds.</p>

    <p>An estate tax return is the form that the executor files with the tax office to report the value of everything the deceased owned and to calculate whether any estate tax is owed. It's similar to an income tax return, but instead of reporting income, it reports the deceased's assets, debts, and any deductions that apply.</p>
    <p>Not every estate needs to file an estate tax return. In jurisdictions that have estate tax, there's usually a threshold below which no return is required. In the United States, for example, only estates exceeding the federal exemption amount (several million dollars) must file a federal estate tax return. Smaller estates generally don't need to file unless they're making certain elections.</p>
    <p>Preparing an estate tax return can be complex. The executor must value all assets as of the date of death (or sometimes an alternate valuation date), report any gifts made during life, calculate allowable deductions for debts and expenses, and apply exemptions correctly. For larger or more complex estates, executors typically hire accountants or tax attorneys to prepare the return.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>In jurisdictions with estate tax, filing the estate tax return is a major milestone in estate administration. The return is typically due within nine to twelve months after death, though extensions may be available. The estate cannot make final distributions until the tax authority has reviewed the return and either accepted it or resolved any issues.</p>
  <p>Even when no estate tax is ultimately owed, filing a return might still be required to officially document the estate's value and establish a public record. Some jurisdictions also use estate tax returns to collect statistics on wealth transfer, even for estates below the taxable threshold.</p>
  <p>In Australia, where estate tax was abolished in 1979, executors don't file estate tax returns. However, they still have other tax obligations including filing final income tax returns for the deceased, tax returns for the estate during administration, and potentially dealing with capital gains tax implications of asset transfers. The absence of estate tax doesn't mean the absence of tax compliance requirements.</p>
