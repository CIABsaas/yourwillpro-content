    <p>**Issue** (noun) — All lineal descendants of a person, including children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and all further generations. The term encompasses both direct offspring and more remote descendants, regardless of how many generations removed. In legal documents, "issue" is often used to describe who inherits when a beneficiary predeceases the testator.</p>

    <p>"Issue" is a formal legal term that means all your descendants—your children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and everyone who descends from you in a direct line.</p>
    <p>It's broader than just saying "children." If you leave property to someone's "issue," you're including not just their kids but their kids' kids and so on, down through all the generations.</p>
    <p>You'll often see this term in wills when dealing with what happens if a beneficiary dies before the testator. For example, a will might say "I leave my estate to my children, but if any child predeceases me, their share goes to their issue." This means if your daughter dies before you, her children (your grandchildren) would inherit her share instead.</p>
    <p>The term doesn't distinguish between children born in or out of marriage, adopted children, or children born through assisted reproduction—modern law treats all children equally as someone's issue. But it typically doesn't include step-children unless they've been legally adopted.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>Understanding "issue" matters both when you're writing a will and when you're reading one.</p>
  <p>When drafting a will, using the term "issue" can be more flexible than naming specific people. If you say your estate goes "to my daughter Sarah, or if she predeceases me, to her issue," you don't need to update your will every time Sarah has another child or her children have children. The term automatically includes whoever her descendants are when you die.</p>
  <p>This is particularly useful for gifts that might not be distributed for many years. In a trust that continues after your death, referring to someone's "issue" ensures that future generations are included without needing to amend the document.</p>
  <p>The main alternative to "issue" is naming people specifically or using terms like "children" or "descendants." Each approach has trade-offs. "Issue" is comprehensive but can seem impersonal. Naming individuals is clear but inflexible. "Children" is straightforward but excludes grandchildren and later generations.</p>
  <p>When you're interpreting a will or trust document that uses "issue," remember it means all descendants, not just the next generation. And if you're a beneficiary wondering whether you're included when a document refers to someone's "issue," the question is: are you descended from that person in a direct line? If yes, you're their issue.</p>
