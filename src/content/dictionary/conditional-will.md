    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>A will that contains a condition that must be satisfied before the will takes effect or before certain gifts are distributed. If the condition is not met, the will or conditional gift fails. Courts interpret conditions strictly.</p>

    <p>A will that only works if something specific happens. Like "This will only applies if I die during my surgery" or "My son gets the house only if he's married." If the condition isn't met, the will doesn't work.</p>
