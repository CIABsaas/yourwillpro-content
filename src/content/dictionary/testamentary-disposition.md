    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>A transfer of property that takes effect at the transferor's death rather than during life. Testamentary dispositions are typically made through wills and must comply with statutory formalities for wills, including proper execution and witnesses.</p>

    <p>A testamentary disposition is when you give something away in your will that the recipient only gets after you die. It's different from a lifetime gift—this gift doesn't happen until you're gone.</p>

  <div class="example-label">EXAMPLE</div>
  <p>"Dad wrote in a letter 'I want my car to go to my son when I die.' That letter wasn't witnessed or properly signed, so it failed as a testamentary disposition. Without proper will formalities, the car went through intestacy with the rest of his estate."</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>Courts are strict about testamentary dispositions—they must meet all the legal requirements for wills, even if the person's intent was clear. An informal note saying "give my house to my daughter" won't work as a testamentary disposition unless it's properly witnessed and executed as a will.</p>
