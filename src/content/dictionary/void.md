    <p>Completely lacking in legal force or effect from inception; null and unenforceable as if it never existed. A void document, will, or transaction is invalid ab initio (from the beginning) and cannot be validated or ratified, regardless of subsequent events or parties' intentions.</p>

    <p>Void means legally worthless—as if it never existed. A void will, contract, or gift has absolutely no legal effect and can't be fixed or enforced, period. It's dead from the start.</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>Many states have laws making gifts to will witnesses void to prevent conflicts of interest. If your will leaves property to someone who then signs as a witness, that gift is typically void—though the rest of the will remains valid if there are enough other witnesses.</p>
