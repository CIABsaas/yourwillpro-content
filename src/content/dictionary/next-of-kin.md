    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>A person's closest living blood relatives, as determined by law. In intestacy, next of kin inherit when someone dies without a will, following statutory rules of priority (spouse, children, parents, siblings). In medical contexts, refers to the person authorized to make decisions for an incapacitated person.</p>

    <p>Your closest living relatives according to law—typically spouse, children, parents, or siblings. The term has different meanings: in inheritance law, it's who inherits if you die without a will. In medical contexts, it's who hospitals contact in emergencies. Important: next of kin is determined by law, not personal choice—you can't just designate anyone, though you can appoint specific people through wills and powers of attorney.</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>Next of kin determined by law often don't match your actual relationships. Stepchildren, unmarried partners (in some jurisdictions), and close friends have no automatic next-of-kin rights. Making a will and appointing powers of attorney ensures your choices—not legal formulas—determine what happens.</p>
