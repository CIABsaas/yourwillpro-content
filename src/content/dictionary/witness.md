    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>A person who observes the execution of a legal document, such as a will, and signs it to attest to its authenticity and proper execution. Most jurisdictions require wills to be witnessed by two or more disinterested parties who can later testify about the testator's capacity and the circumstances of signing.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column-card plain-column">
    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>A witness watches you sign your will and then signs it themselves to confirm they saw you do it and that you seemed mentally capable. Most states require at least two witnesses for a will to be valid.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="compare-item">
      <div class="compare-term">Notary</div>

<div class="why-matters">
  <h3>💡 Why this matters</h3>
  <p>Without proper witnesses, your will is invalid—as if you never made one. This means dying intestate, with the state deciding who inherits. Even if you have witnesses, choosing beneficiaries as witnesses can void their gifts. Finding appropriate witnesses and following formalities exactly is essential.</p>
  <p>One small error in witnessing can invalidate an entire will.</p>
</div>

<div class="common-mistakes">
  <h3>⚠️ Common mistakes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Having beneficiaries witness the will—this can void their inheritance</li>
    <li>Not having witnesses present at the same time you sign</li>
    <li>Using witnesses under 18 or mentally incapable</li>
    <li>Forgetting to have witnesses sign in your presence, or not signing in theirs</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="did-you-know">
  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>Witnesses should generally be "disinterested"—not beneficiaries under the will. In many states, if a beneficiary witnesses the will, their gift becomes void (though the rest of the will remains valid). Always use witnesses who aren't inheriting anything to avoid complications.</p>
