    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>A formal public notice published by an executor or administrator calling upon all creditors of the deceased to present claims against the estate within a specified time period. Typically published in newspapers and sometimes online. Creditors who fail to make claims within the specified period may be barred from recovering debts from the estate.</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>A public announcement saying: "If the deceased owed you money, you have a limited time to claim it from the estate. If you don't claim by the deadline, you might miss out." The executor publishes this notice in newspapers (and sometimes online) to find unknown creditors. Sets a deadline—typically 2-6 months. After the deadline passes and known debts are paid, the executor can distribute the estate with protection against surprise claims later.</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>Notice to creditors protects executors from personal liability. If you distribute an estate without giving proper notice and an unknown creditor appears later, you might have to pay the debt from your own pocket. The notice process lets you distribute the estate with confidence that no surprise debts will emerge.</p>
