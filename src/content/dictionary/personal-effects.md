    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>Tangible personal property consisting of items of intimate use or personal nature, typically including clothing, jewelry, photographs, personal papers, household furnishings, and similar items. The precise definition varies by jurisdiction and context. Generally excludes real estate, business assets, financial accounts, and vehicles (though some definitions include vehicles).</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>Your personal belongings—the things you use in daily life. Typically includes clothing, jewelry, books, photographs, furniture, household items, collections, and mementos. Usually excludes your house, car, bank accounts, and business interests. "Personal effects" doesn't have one single legal definition—it means different things in different contexts, so many wills define it specifically to avoid confusion.</p>

  <p>"Mom's will left her house to my brother and her bank accounts to me, but said 'my personal effects to my children to divide as they see fit.' We argued for months over who should get her jewelry and photo albums."</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>Personal effects cause more family conflict than financial assets, despite often having lower monetary value. Grandmother's $2,000 ring can cause more fighting than a $50,000 bank account, because sentimental value and perceived favoritism matter more than money. Consider leaving specific instructions for cherished items to prevent disputes.</p>
