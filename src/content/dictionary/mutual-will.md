    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>Wills made by two people with a binding contractual agreement not to change them without the other's consent. If one dies and the survivor later changes their will, a court may impose a constructive trust to enforce the original agreement.</p>

    <p>Wills made by a couple who've agreed not to change them. Unlike mirror wills, this is a binding contract. Typically used when couples want to ensure property ultimately goes to specific people (like children from previous relationships). If the survivor changes their will after the first dies, the court may enforce the original agreement. Generally not recommended due to inflexibility.</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>Mutual wills create serious inflexibility—the survivor may be bound for decades, unable to respond to changed circumstances like estrangement, remarriage, or financial changes. Most lawyers recommend testamentary trusts or life interests instead, which achieve similar protection with more flexibility.</p>
