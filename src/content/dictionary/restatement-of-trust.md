    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>A comprehensive revision of a revocable trust that restates all trust terms from the beginning while maintaining the original trust's existence and tax identification number. Unlike an amendment which modifies specific provisions, a restatement replaces the entire trust document with updated terms while keeping the same trust entity.</p>
  </div>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>A restatement is like rewriting your trust from scratch while keeping the same trust legally in place. Instead of making lots of individual amendments, you create a whole new document that replaces everything in the original trust. The trust itself doesn't end—you're just completely updating its instructions.</p>

<div class="did-you-know">
  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>A restatement doesn't require retitling assets or getting a new tax identification number because the trust itself continues to exist—you're just updating its terms. This makes restatements much simpler than revoking the old trust and creating an entirely new one.</p>
