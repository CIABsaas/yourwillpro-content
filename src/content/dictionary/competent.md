    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>Being competent means you have the mental ability to understand what you're doing and make informed decisions. It's about whether you can comprehend the choices you're making and their consequences.</p>
    <p>Competence is presumed for adults. Unless proven otherwise, the law assumes you're capable of making your own decisions. Challenges to competence require evidence that someone doesn't understand their actions or can't process information necessary for decision-making.</p>
    <p>Competence isn't all-or-nothing. Someone might be competent to make simple decisions but not complex ones. They might have good days and bad days. Competence is evaluated for specific decisions at specific times, not as a permanent general state.</p>
