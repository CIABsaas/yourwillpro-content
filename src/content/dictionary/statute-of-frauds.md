    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>Statutory requirements mandating that certain types of contracts must be in writing and signed to be legally enforceable, primarily to prevent fraud and perjury. Common categories include contracts for the sale of land, contracts that cannot be performed within one year, and promises to pay another's debts. In estate planning, the statute typically requires wills, trusts, and real property transfers to be in writing.</p>

    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>The statute of frauds says certain agreements must be in writing or they don't count. You can't make a verbal will or verbally sell land—these must be written and signed. The law prevents people from lying about agreements that were supposedly made orally.</p>

  <div class="example-label">EXAMPLE</div>
  <p>"My sister claimed Dad verbally promised to leave her the house, but she had nothing in writing. Because the statute of frauds requires real property transfers to be in writing, her oral agreement claim failed. If Dad really wanted her to have the house, he should have put it in his will."</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>The statute of frauds dates back to 1677 England, enacted to prevent fraudulent claims about agreements. The law recognized that people might lie about oral promises, especially regarding valuable land or estates, so it required written proof.</p>
