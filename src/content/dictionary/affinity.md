    <p>Affinity is the formal legal term for relationships created by marriage. Your spouse's parents, siblings, and other blood relatives are related to you by affinity, not by blood.</p>
    <p>In everyday language, we call these people in-laws. In legal language, the relationship is described as affinity.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>This distinction matters in some legal contexts, particularly around inheritance when someone dies without a will (intestate) and in certain prohibited relationship rules.</p>
  <p>In most Australian intestacy laws, relationships by affinity don't automatically create inheritance rights—your brother-in-law typically wouldn't inherit from you if you died without a will, even if you were close. However, they might have grounds for a family provision claim if they were financially dependent on you.</p>
