    <div class="column-label">PLAIN ENGLISH</div>
    <p>Executrix is simply the old-fashioned word for a female executor. It means exactly the same thing as executor, just specifying that the person is a woman. In modern legal practice, the term "executor" is now used for everyone regardless of gender.</p>
    <p>The distinction between executor and executrix comes from a time when English legal language routinely used different terms for men and women in the same role. You might also encounter similar pairs like testator/testatrix (person making a will), administrator/administratrix (person administering an intestate estate), or heir/heiress.</p>
    <p>These gendered terms are falling out of use in contemporary legal writing. Most modern wills, legal documents, and court proceedings simply use "executor" for everyone. Using "executor" is clearer, simpler, and reflects current language practices. However, you might still encounter "executrix" in older wills or historical legal documents.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>If you see the term "executrix" in a will or legal document, it just means the executor happens to be a woman. The role, responsibilities, powers, and duties are identical regardless of which term is used. An executrix does exactly what an executor does: administers the estate, manages assets, pays debts, and distributes property according to the will.</p>
  <p>When you're making your own will, there's no need to use "executrix" even if you're appointing a woman. Simply use "executor" for anyone you appoint. Modern legal practice favors gender-neutral language, and using "executor" for everyone is now standard practice in most jurisdictions.</p>
  <p>Some older legal forms or templates might still include the term "executrix," but this is increasingly rare. If you're reviewing or updating an old will that uses this term, don't worry about it—the meaning is clear. When you prepare a new will, your solicitor or will provider will use current terminology.</p>
