    <div class="column-label">LEGAL DEFINITION</div>
    <p>A person's mother or father. In legal contexts, particularly inheritance and family law, "parent" typically includes biological parents and adoptive parents, but generally excludes step-parents unless specifically stated otherwise or they've legally adopted the child. For intestacy and family provision claims, parents are a defined class with specific rights.</p>

    <p>Your mother or father. For legal purposes: biological parents and adoptive parents are legal parents with full inheritance rights. Step-parents are NOT legal parents unless they've legally adopted you—even if they raised you from childhood. This matters for inheritance: if your step-father dies without a will and never adopted you, you don't inherit under intestacy rules, even if he raised you for 20 years.</p>

  <p>"My step-dad raised me from age 5 and we're very close, but he never legally adopted me. When he died without a will, I couldn't inherit under intestacy laws—only his biological children could. He should have made a will."</p>

  <h3>💡 Did you know?</h3>
  <p>Step-parents have no automatic inheritance rights to step-children's estates, and step-children have no automatic rights to step-parents' estates—unless there's been a legal adoption. If you want step-children to inherit, you must name them specifically in your will or legally adopt them.</p>
