    <p>**Declaration of Trust** (noun) — A formal document in which a person declares that they hold legal title to property as trustee for the benefit of another person or persons.</p>

    <p>A declaration of trust is a document where someone says "I own this property legally, but I'm holding it for someone else's benefit." It creates a trust relationship without transferring ownership on paper—the trustee already owns the property legally, but now acknowledges they hold it for beneficiaries.</p>
    <p>This is different from a trust created by transfer. In that case, you give property to a trustee. With a declaration of trust, you already own the property and declare yourself trustee of it for others.</p>
    <p>A common example is a parent who buys a house in their own name but declares they're holding it in trust for their child. The parent's name stays on the title, but the declaration of trust establishes the child as the beneficial owner.</p>

  <h3>⏱ When you'll encounter this term</h3>
  <p>Declarations of trust appear frequently in family property arrangements. Parents helping children buy property, couples clarifying ownership interests, or business partners documenting beneficial ownership all use declarations of trust.</p>
  <p>The declaration must be clear about who the beneficiaries are, what property is held in trust, and what the trustee's responsibilities are. Without proper documentation, disputes arise about whether a trust actually exists and what its terms are.</p>
  <p>You'll encounter declarations of trust in property transactions, family wealth transfers, and estate planning. They're useful for separating legal ownership (who holds title) from beneficial ownership (who actually benefits from the property). This separation can have significant tax, estate planning, and asset protection implications.</p>
