<div class="quick-answer">
  <h4>Probate in 60 Seconds</h4>
  <p>Probate is the court's official validation of a will. It confirms the executor has legal authority to administer the estate. In Australia, probate is required for most estates with assets over $15,000-$50,000 (varies by state and institution). The process typically takes <strong>2-6 months for straightforward estates</strong>, longer for complex or contested situations. Costs include court fees ($100-$900) plus legal fees if you use a solicitor. Without a will, a similar process called "letters of administration" is required.</p>

## What is probate?

<p class="lead-paragraph">When someone dies, their will is just a piece of paper. It has no legal force until a court validates it.</p>

**Probate** is the legal process where the Supreme Court of your state or territory officially recognises a will as valid and gives the executor authority to deal with the deceased's estate.

The court issues a document called a **Grant of Probate** — essentially a certificate that says:
1. This will is genuine and valid
2. This executor has the right to act
3. Financial institutions and government agencies must recognise the executor's authority

Without probate, banks, share registries, and land registries often refuse to release assets or transfer property. The executor has no legal proof they can act.

---

## When is probate required?

Not every estate needs probate. Whether you need it depends on:

1. **The value of the assets**
2. **The type of assets**
3. **The policies of the institutions holding the assets**

    <h4>Probate Thresholds by State</h4>
    <p>Each Australian state and territory has different thresholds, and financial institutions often have their own internal limits. Below are typical thresholds, but <strong>always check with the specific institution</strong> holding the assets.</p>
  </div>
</div>

### Typical state thresholds (2025)

**New South Wales:**
- Banks: Usually require probate for balances over $50,000-$100,000
- Real estate: Probate almost always required
- Shares: Usually required for portfolios over $15,000-$30,000

**Victoria:**
- Banks: Usually require probate for balances over $50,000
- Real estate: Probate always required
- Shares: Usually required for portfolios over $15,000

**Queensland:**
- Banks: Usually require probate for balances over $20,000-$50,000
- Real estate: Probate always required
- Shares: Usually required for portfolios over $10,000

**South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania, NT, ACT:**
- Similar thresholds, but check with each institution

<div class="warning-box">

  </svg>
  <div>
    <h4>Thresholds Are Guidelines Only</h4>
    <p>Even if the estate is below the threshold, some institutions may still require probate. Conversely, some may release funds without probate on a case-by-case basis. Always ask.</p>
  </div>
</div>

### Assets that almost always require probate

- **Real estate** held in the deceased's sole name
- **Shares** in publicly listed companies
- **Bank accounts** over the institution's threshold
- **Business interests** where the deceased was sole owner or partner

### Assets that usually DON'T require probate

- **Joint assets** with a right of survivorship (automatically pass to the surviving owner)
- **Superannuation** with a valid binding death benefit nomination
- **Life insurance** with a nominated beneficiary
- **Assets held in trust** where the deceased was a beneficiary but not the legal owner
- **Small bank balances** under the institution's threshold

## The probate process: Step by step

Here's what actually happens when you apply for probate.

### Step 1: Locate the will and death certificate

**Timeline: Week 1**

- Obtain official death certificate from the Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages
- Locate the original will (copies are not acceptable)
- Identify all assets and liabilities
- Notify beneficiaries that probate will be applied for

### Step 2: Prepare the probate application

**Timeline: Weeks 2-4**

The executor (or their solicitor) prepares documents including:

**The application itself:**
- Form identifying the deceased, the executor, and the will
- Sworn affidavit confirming the will is genuine
- Details of assets and liabilities

**Supporting documents:**
- Original will
- Death certificate
- Inventory of assets and their values
- Valuation reports if needed

**Notice to potential claimants:**
- In some states, you must advertise the probate application in newspapers
- Gives creditors and potential claimants time to come forward

### Step 3: File with the Supreme Court

**Timeline: Week 4-5**

- Application is filed with your state's Supreme Court
- Court filing fees paid (varies by state, typically $100-$900)
- Court staff review the application for completeness

<div class="tip-box">
  <svg class="tip-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2">
    <circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/>
    <path d="M12 16v-4M12 8h.01"/>
  </svg>
  <div>
    <h4>Tip: Get It Right First Time</h4>
    <p>Incomplete or incorrect applications are rejected by the court, causing delays. Most executors use a solicitor for this step to avoid errors and speed up the process.</p>
  </div>
</div>

### Step 4: Court review and waiting period

**Timeline: Weeks 6-10**

- Court reviews the application
- Waiting period for objections (usually 14 days after advertisement)
- If no issues, court prepares the Grant of Probate

### Step 5: Grant of Probate issued

**Timeline: Week 8-12** (for straightforward cases)

- Court issues the Grant of Probate
- Executor receives sealed copies
- Executor can now legally administer the estate

**What the Grant of Probate proves:**
- The will is valid
- The named executor has authority to act
- Financial institutions must comply with the executor's instructions

### Step 6: Administer the estate

**Timeline: Months 3-18+**

Now the real work begins:
- Collect all assets
- Pay all debts and liabilities
- File tax returns
- Distribute assets to beneficiaries
- Finalise the estate

---

## How long does probate take?

The timeline varies significantly based on complexity and location.

### Straightforward estates (no complications)

**2-4 months** from death to receiving Grant of Probate

**Requirements:**
- Valid, uncontested will
- No complex assets
- No family disputes
- All documents in order
- Competent executor or solicitor handling the process

### Average estates (minor complications)

**4-9 months** from death to receiving Grant of Probate

**Common delays:**
- Missing documents
- Hard-to-value assets (business interests, overseas property)
- Multiple executors who need to coordinate
- Beneficiaries living overseas
- Small estate, but executor wants to do it themselves without legal help

### Complex or contested estates

**12 months to several years**

**Causes of major delays:**
- Will is contested
- Family provision claims
- Executor disputes
- Complex business interests or trusts
- Cross-border assets
- Tax disputes
- Missing beneficiaries

<div class="real-case">
  <h4>📖 Related Story: The House Sat Empty</h4>
  <p>A Queensland executor failed to progress probate for over three years. The family home sat vacant, unfulfilled tax returns accumulated, and beneficiaries received nothing. The court eventually removed the executor and appointed someone else. Probate should have taken months, not years.</p>

## Probate costs and fees

### Court filing fees (2025)

**NSW:** ~$900 for estates over $100,000, $105 for smaller estates
**Victoria:** ~$500 for most estates
**Queensland:** ~$700 for estates over $500,000, $250 for smaller estates
**South Australia:** ~$450
**Western Australia:** ~$300
**Tasmania:** ~$240
**ACT:** ~$300
**NT:** ~$100

*Fees increase periodically. Check your state Supreme Court website for current rates.*

### Legal fees

Most executors engage a solicitor to prepare the probate application.

**DIY probate:**
- Court fees only
- Free if you do all the work yourself
- Risk of errors causing delays

**Solicitor-assisted probate:**
- Typical range: $2,000 - $6,000 for straightforward estates
- Complex estates: $10,000 - $30,000+
- Some solicitors charge hourly, some charge a percentage of the estate

**What you're paying for:**
- Preparing all documents correctly
- Liaising with the court
- Advising on legal requirements
- Avoiding delays and errors
- Professional indemnity if something goes wrong

### Estate administration fees

Probate is just the first step. Administering the entire estate (collecting assets, paying debts, distributing to beneficiaries) takes longer and costs more.

**Executor's commission:**
- Executors can claim up to 5% of the estate value in most states (but must justify it)
- Many family executors don't take a fee
- Professional executors charge standard rates

**Ongoing legal fees:**
- May be charged for estate administration beyond just obtaining probate
- Varies widely depending on complexity

---

## What if there's no will?

If someone dies without a valid will (intestate), you need **Letters of Administration** instead of probate.

### How Letters of Administration differ

**Similarities:**
- Also issued by the Supreme Court
- Gives someone legal authority to administer the estate
- Similar timeline and process
- Similar costs

**Differences:**
- No will to validate (distribution follows intestacy laws instead)
- Court appoints an administrator (usually the closest eligible relative)
- May require additional steps, like taking out a bond
- May require all eligible next-of-kin to consent or renounce their rights
- Generally more complex and expensive than probate

<div class="australia-note">

    <circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/>
    <path d="M12 8v4M12 16h.01"/>
  </svg>
  <div>
    <h4>Who Can Apply for Letters of Administration</h4>
    <p>Each state has rules about who can apply, usually in this order: spouse/de facto partner, children, parents, siblings, other relatives. If multiple people are in the same category (e.g., three adult children), they may all need to apply jointly or some must formally renounce their right.</p>

## Common reasons probate is delayed

1. **Missing or defective will**
   - Can't find the original will
   - Will not properly signed or witnessed
   - Multiple wills with conflicting provisions

2. **Executor issues**
   - Named executor can't be located
   - Executor refuses to act
   - Multiple executors can't agree
   - Executor is overseas

3. **Asset valuation problems**
   - Business interests hard to value
   - Property disputes about ownership
   - Overseas assets requiring foreign valuations

4. **Family disputes**
   - Beneficiaries contest the will
   - Family provision claims filed
   - Questions about the will-maker's capacity

5. **Administrative errors**
   - Application rejected due to mistakes
   - Missing documents
   - Incorrect forms
   - Affidavits not properly sworn

6. **Court delays**
   - Court backlogs (especially in major cities)
   - Public holidays
   - Judge unavailability for hearings

---

## Contested wills and probate

Sometimes people challenge a will during the probate process.

### Common grounds for contesting

- **Lack of testamentary capacity** — will-maker didn't understand what they were doing
- **Undue influence** — someone pressured the will-maker
- **Fraud or forgery** — the will isn't genuine
- **Improper execution** — not signed or witnessed correctly
- **Lack of knowledge and approval** — will-maker didn't know or approve the contents

### What happens

- A caveat (formal objection) is filed with the court
- Probate is frozen until the dispute is resolved
- Parties may need to go to court to argue their case
- Can add months or years to the process
- Very expensive for the estate

  </svg>
  <div>
    <h4>Contested Wills Are Expensive</h4>
    <p>Legal costs for a contested will case can easily exceed $50,000-$100,000. These costs typically come out of the estate, reducing what beneficiaries receive. The best will disputes are the ones that never happen — achieved through clear drafting, proper execution, and communication with family.</p>

## Can you avoid probate?

Some people try to structure their affairs to avoid probate entirely.

### Strategies to minimise probate

**Joint ownership with right of survivorship:**
- Property passes automatically to the surviving owner
- Bank accounts in joint names
- Doesn't go through probate

**Binding death benefit nominations:**
- Superannuation paid directly to nominated beneficiaries
- Bypasses the estate and probate

**Trust structures:**
- Assets held in trust don't form part of your estate
- Can continue operating after your death

**Payable-on-death accounts:**
- Some institutions allow POD nominations
- Funds go directly to named beneficiary

**Small estates:**
- Keep estate value below probate thresholds where possible

### Why avoiding probate isn't always best

While avoiding probate sounds attractive, it's not always the right strategy:

- **You lose control** — joint assets go to the joint owner, not according to your will
- **Tax implications** — some strategies have adverse tax consequences
- **No court oversight** — probate provides protection against fraud and mistakes
- **Inflexible** — hard to change if circumstances change
- **May not save money** — setting up complex structures can cost more than probate

## Final thought

Probate isn't something to fear — it's a protective process that validates your will and gives your executor the authority they need.

Yes, it takes time. Yes, it costs money. But it also prevents fraud, ensures your will is properly executed, and gives your family certainty that everything is being done correctly.

The best way to make probate smooth? Have a properly drafted, up-to-date will. Choose an executor who's willing and capable. Keep good records of your assets. And communicate your intentions to your family.

Do that, and probate becomes a formality rather than an ordeal.
