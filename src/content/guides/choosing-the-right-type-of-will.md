## Overview

<p class="lead-paragraph">A will is a legal document that says what happens to your assets when you die. But there's more than one type — and <strong>choosing the right one</strong> can save your family time, money, and stress.</p>

This guide breaks down the main types of wills, who they're suited for, and what to watch out for.

---

## Who this is for

- Anyone making a will for the first time
- People reviewing an existing will
- Anyone unsure whether their current will still fits their circumstances

---

## Before you start

<p class="lead-paragraph">Before choosing a type of will, you should have a rough idea of your situation.</p>

<div class="checklist">
  <h4>Essential Information to Gather</h4>
  <div class="checklist-item">What you own — property, savings, investments, superannuation, vehicles, valuables</div>
  <div class="checklist-item">Who you want to benefit — spouse, children, family, friends, charities</div>
  <div class="checklist-item">Your family structure — married, de facto, blended family, dependants with special needs</div>
  <div class="checklist-item">Any complications — business interests, overseas assets, family disputes</div>
</div>

## Types of wills

### 1. Simple will

A straightforward will that leaves everything to one or more people — usually a spouse, then children.

**Best for:**
- Single people with simple assets
- Couples with shared goals and no blended families
- Smaller estates with no business interests

**Watch out for:**
- May not protect assets if your beneficiary divorces, goes bankrupt, or has a disability
- Doesn't account for assets like superannuation (which usually needs a separate nomination)

---

### 2. Testamentary trust will

A will that creates one or more trusts *after* you die. Assets are held in trust rather than given outright.

**Best for:**
- Parents with young children
- Blended families
- Beneficiaries who may be vulnerable — due to age, disability, addiction, or financial instability
- People wanting to protect assets from a beneficiary's divorce or creditors

**Watch out for:**
- More expensive to set up
- Ongoing administration required after death
- Needs a trustee to manage the trust

<div class="example-box">
  <h4>Example</h4>
  <p>"Sarah has two children under 10. Her testamentary trust will ensures if she dies, their inheritance is managed by trustees until they're 25 — protecting them from spending it too young or losing it in a divorce."</p>
</div>

<div class="success-box">
  <svg class="success-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2">
    <path d="M22 11.08V12a10 10 0 1 1-5.93-9.14"/>
    <polyline points="22 4 12 14.01 9 11.01"/>
  </svg>
  <div>
    <h4>Best Practice: Consider for All Families with Children</h4>
    <p>A testamentary trust will is often recommended for families with minor children, even if the estate is modest. It protects assets and provides flexibility.</p>
  </div>
</div>

---

### 3. Mutual wills

Two separate wills (usually by spouses) made on the understanding that neither will be changed without the other's consent.

**Best for:**
- Couples who want certainty that their wishes won't be overridden after one dies
- Blended families where each partner wants to protect their own children

**Watch out for:**
- Can create legal complications if one party wants to change their will later
- Rarely recommended by modern estate lawyers — binding death benefit nominations or testamentary trusts often work better

---

### 4. Mirror wills

Two wills that are almost identical — each partner leaves everything to the other, then to the same beneficiaries.

**Best for:**
- Couples with shared assets and shared wishes
- Simple family structures

**Watch out for:**
- Not legally binding — either party can change their will at any time
- After one partner dies, the survivor is free to rewrite their will entirely

> 💡 **Note:** Mirror wills are common, but they don't guarantee your wishes will be followed after you're gone.

---

### 5. Statutory will

A will made by a court on behalf of someone who lacks capacity to make their own.

**Best for:**
- People with dementia, brain injury, or intellectual disability who never made a will — or whose existing will no longer reflects their circumstances

**Watch out for:**
- Requires a court application
- Can be expensive and time-consuming
- Only granted if the court is satisfied the proposed will reflects what the person would have wanted

## Common mistakes

<p class="lead-paragraph">Even with the best intentions, people make avoidable mistakes when choosing and creating their wills. Here are the most common errors to watch out for.</p>

<div class="warning-box">
  <svg class="warning-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2">
    <path d="M12 9v2m0 4h.01m-6.938 4h13.856c1.54 0 2.502-1.667 1.732-3L13.732 4c-.77-1.333-2.694-1.333-3.464 0L3.34 16c-.77 1.333.192 3 1.732 3z"/>
  </svg>
  <div>
    <h4>Warning: DIY Wills Have Serious Limitations</h4>
    <p>Online wills can be valid, but they often miss tax planning, trust structures, and superannuation coordination. What saves $300 now can cost your family $30,000 later.</p>
  </div>
</div>

**Other common pitfalls:**

1. **Choosing a simple will when your situation isn't simple**
   - Blended families, young children, and vulnerable beneficiaries usually need more than a basic will

2. **Assuming mirror wills are binding**
   - They're not. The surviving spouse can change everything.

3. **Forgetting about assets outside the will**
   - Superannuation, joint property, and life insurance often pass outside your will unless you take specific steps

4. **Not reviewing your will after life changes**
   - Marriage, divorce, children, and property purchases can all affect whether your will still works

<div class="key-takeaway">
  <h4><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><path d="M22 11.08V12a10 10 0 1 1-5.93-9.14"/><polyline points="22 4 12 14.01 9 11.01"/></svg> Key Takeaway</h4>
  <p>The right type of will depends on your family structure, not your estate size. Complex families need structured protection, even with modest assets.</p>
</div>

## When to get help

**You can probably manage on your own if:**
- Your situation is simple — one relationship, no children, modest assets
- You understand what you're doing and the risks

**You should see a professional if:**
- You have children under 18
- You're in a blended family
- You have a business or complex assets
- You have overseas assets or beneficiaries
- You're concerned about someone challenging your will
- You want tax planning or asset protection
- You have a family member with a disability or special needs
- You're unsure which type of will you need

> **Remember:** The cost of getting it wrong later is almost always higher than the cost of getting it right now.
