<div class="quick-answer">
  <h4>Quick Answer for Business Owners</h4>
  <p>Your business doesn't automatically transfer smoothly when you die. Depending on your business structure (sole trader, partnership, company, trust), different rules apply. You need: <strong>a current will</strong> addressing business ownership, <strong>succession planning</strong> separate from estate planning, <strong>buy-sell agreements</strong> if you have partners, <strong>key person insurance</strong> to protect business value, and <strong>tax planning</strong> for CGT and small business concessions. Don't assume your family can run or want to run your business. Plan early and professionally.</p>

## Overview

<p class="lead-paragraph">If you own a business, your estate planning is more complicated than most people's — and infinitely more important.</p>

Your business might be:
- Your largest asset
- Your family's primary source of income
- Something you've spent decades building
- A source of employment for others
- Your legacy

When you die, your business doesn't pause while your estate is sorted out. Suppliers need to be paid. Customers need to be served. Employees need direction. Decisions need to be made.

If your business isn't properly addressed in your estate plan, it can:
- Lose value rapidly without clear leadership
- Be forced to close, destroying wealth you spent years building
- Create conflict between your business partners and your family
- Generate massive tax bills
- Leave your family unable to access income they depend on

This guide explains how to protect your business and ensure it survives your death — whether that means continuing operations, selling it, or winding it up in an orderly way.

## Business structures and what happens when you die

What happens to your business depends entirely on how it's legally structured.

### Sole trader

**Structure:** You own and operate the business personally. The business and you are legally the same entity.

**What happens when you die:**
- The business dies with you
- Your business assets (equipment, stock, intellectual property, goodwill) become part of your estate
- Your executor can sell the assets, but can't continue operating the business in your name
- Contracts with suppliers, customers, and employees may terminate automatically
- Business licences and permits usually can't be transferred

**The risk:**
Without immediate action, the business ceases. Time-sensitive assets (like client relationships and goodwill) evaporate. Your family receives only the liquidation value of physical assets.

**Example: Martin's café**

Martin owned a popular café as a sole trader. When he died suddenly, his will left everything to his wife Anna. But as a sole trader business, the café couldn't legally continue under Anna's management — she would need to close it and reopen under her own ABN, reapply for licences, and renegotiate the lease.

By the time the executor dealt with probate (3 months), the café had already lost its staff and customers. The business that was worth $300,000 as a going concern sold for $40,000 (just equipment and stock).

**The fix:**
- Operate through a company or trust structure instead
- Have a succession plan for someone to take over immediately
- Document key business processes so someone else can operate it
- Consider life insurance to fund a business wind-up if needed

---

### Partnership

**Structure:** You and one or more partners co-own the business.

**What happens when you die:**
- By default, most partnership agreements dissolve on death of a partner
- Your share of the partnership becomes an asset of your estate
- Surviving partners may be forced to buy out your share or wind up the business
- Partnership debts and liabilities may pass to your estate

**The risk:**
Your surviving partners might not have cash to buy out your share. Your family might be stuck owning part of a business they can't control. The partnership may be forced to liquidate at the worst possible time.

**Example: The forced buy-out**

David and Sam ran an accounting firm as equal partners. When David died, his 50% share passed to his wife Jessica under his will. But Jessica had no accounting qualifications and couldn't work in the business.

The partnership agreement required Jessica to sell her share back to Sam within 12 months. Sam didn't have $400,000 cash to buy her out. The business was forced to take out a loan, crippling its cash flow. Jessica waited 18 months to receive full payment. Both sides lost.

**The fix:**
- Have a written partnership agreement addressing death of a partner
- Include a buy-sell agreement (see below)
- Fund the buy-sell agreement with life insurance
- Specify valuation methods and payment terms in advance

---

### Company

**Structure:** The business is owned by a company. You own shares in the company.

**What happens when you die:**
- The company continues to exist (companies don't die)
- Your shares in the company pass according to your will
- The company's operations aren't automatically affected
- Directors continue to manage the company

**The advantage:**
Companies provide continuity. The business keeps operating while your estate is sorted out.

**The risk:**
Who controls the shares controls the company. If your shares pass to someone who doesn't understand the business or has different goals, they can destroy value.

**Example: The family conflict**

Robert owned 100% of a construction company through a family trust. His will left 60% of the shares to his son (who worked in the business) and 40% to his daughter (who didn't).

After Robert's death, his son wanted to reinvest profits to grow the business. His daughter wanted dividends for income. Deadlock. The company couldn't make strategic decisions. Key staff left. The business value declined by 40% over three years.

**The fix:**
- Use shareholder agreements to govern decision-making
- Consider different share classes with different rights (voting vs non-voting, income vs growth)
- Implement buy-sell agreements between shareholders
- Use trusts to give flexibility in distributing benefits

---

### Trust

**Structure:** A trust owns the business assets. You control the trust as trustee or director of a corporate trustee.

**What happens when you die:**
- The trust continues to exist
- Your role as trustee passes according to the trust deed
- Business operations can continue uninterrupted
- Trust assets don't form part of your estate (you don't own them — the trust does)

**The advantage:**
Trusts provide excellent continuity and asset protection. The business keeps operating regardless of what happens to you.

**The risk:**
Complex to administer. Requires proper succession planning for trustee positions. Your family may not benefit from the trust assets if the deed doesn't provide for them.

**The fix:**
- Review your trust deed to ensure it addresses succession of trustees
- Consider appointing a corporate trustee (company) for continuity
- Ensure your will and the trust deed work together
- Document who should control the trust after your death

## Buy-sell agreements explained

A **buy-sell agreement** (also called a business succession agreement) is a contract between business co-owners that controls what happens to a person's share of the business when they die, become disabled, or want to exit.

### How it works

**The agreement says:**
1. If a business owner dies, their share must be sold
2. Who it must be sold to (usually the other owners)
3. What price will be paid (usually a predetermined formula)
4. How payment will be funded (usually life insurance)
5. The timeframe for the buyout

**Why you need one:**

Without a buy-sell agreement:
- Your family might be stuck owning part of a business they can't control
- Your partners might be stuck in business with your spouse or children
- No one agrees on what the business is worth
- No one has cash to buy anyone out
- The business may need to be sold to a third party at fire-sale prices

### Types of buy-sell agreements

**Cross-purchase agreement:**
- Each owner buys life insurance on the other owners
- When one dies, the survivors use insurance proceeds to buy the deceased's share
- Works well for 2-3 partners

**Entity-purchase agreement:**
- The business entity (company, trust) buys life insurance on each owner
- When one dies, the entity buys back their share
- Simpler for businesses with many owners

**Hybrid agreement:**
- Combination of both methods
- Provides flexibility

### Funding the buy-sell agreement

**Life insurance:**
Most buy-sell agreements are funded with life insurance. Each partner is insured for the value of their share.

**Example: How insurance funds a buyout**

Tom and Jerry own a plumbing business worth $1 million (50/50). They each take out $500,000 life insurance on the other.

When Tom dies, Jerry receives $500,000 from the insurance policy. He uses it to buy Tom's 50% share from Tom's estate. Tom's family receives $500,000 cash. Jerry owns 100% of the business. Both sides get what they need.

**Without insurance:**
Jerry would need to find $500,000 from savings or by borrowing. Tom's family would wait months or years for payment. The business might be forced to close.

## Key person insurance

**Key person insurance** protects the business if a key person (usually you, the owner) dies or becomes disabled.

### The problem

Your business might rely heavily on you for:
- Client relationships
- Technical expertise
- Management decisions
- Bank guarantees and credit facilities
- Key supplier relationships

When you die, the business might:
- Lose clients who only dealt with you
- Lose operational capacity
- Face loan recalls (many business loans have "key person" clauses)
- Lose value rapidly

### The solution

The business takes out life insurance on you. The payout goes to the business (not your family) to cover:
- Recruitment and training of a replacement
- Paying off business debts
- Covering lost revenue during transition
- Retaining staff
- Providing working capital

**How much insurance?**
Typically 1-3 times your annual contribution to business revenue, plus enough to cover debts.

## Succession planning vs estate planning

These are related but different concepts.

### Estate planning for business owners

**Focuses on:** What happens to your ownership interest when you die

**Questions it answers:**
- Who inherits your shares/business interest?
- How is it valued?
- How are taxes paid?
- How does your family receive income from the business?

### Succession planning

**Focuses on:** Who runs the business after you're gone

**Questions it answers:**
- Who manages daily operations?
- Who makes strategic decisions?
- How is leadership transferred?
- How are key staff retained?
- Who has the skills to continue the business?

**You need both.**

Your will might leave your business to your children (estate planning), but if none of them can run it (succession planning), the business fails anyway.

## Family businesses: Keeping it fair

One of the hardest issues: how do you treat children fairly when one works in the business and others don't?

### The competing interests

**Child working in the business:**
- Has invested years of their life in the business
- Wants to inherit and continue it
- May have foregone higher pay elsewhere
- Feels they've "earned" the business

**Children not in the business:**
- Want equal treatment
- Don't want to own a business they can't control
- Need their inheritance in a liquid, usable form

**Example: The unequal inheritance**

Helen owned a retail business worth $800,000. Her son Adam worked in it for 15 years. Her daughter Beth was a teacher.

Helen's will left the business to Adam and $300,000 cash to Beth. Helen thought this was fair — Adam got the business he'd worked in, Beth got equivalent value.

But when Helen died, Adam discovered the business was actually only worth $500,000 (Helen's valuation was optimistic). Beth received $300,000. Adam received a business worth $500,000 — but had to pay Beth's $300,000 inheritance from his share of the estate. He effectively received $200,000.

Adam felt robbed. Beth felt short-changed. Both resented their mother's will.

### Better approaches

**Option 1: Equalisation clauses**
Leave the business to the child who works in it, but require them to pay other beneficiaries from business cash flow or sale proceeds to equalise values.

**Option 2: Life insurance equalisation**
Use life insurance to provide cash to non-business children, leaving the business to the child who works in it.

**Option 3: Keep the family out of it**
Sell the business while you're alive or upon death, then distribute cash equally.

**Option 4: Gradual transition**
Sell the business to the working child over time at market rates, using vendor finance. They "earn" ownership.

## Business debts and personal liability

  </svg>
  <div>
    <h4>Personal Guarantees Don't Die With You</h4>
    <p>If you've personally guaranteed business debts, those guarantees usually survive your death. Your estate — and your family's inheritance — may be liable for business debts you guaranteed.</p>
  </div>
</div>

### Structure matters

**Sole trader:**
- You are personally liable for all business debts
- Business debts must be paid from your estate before beneficiaries receive anything
- Can wipe out your family's inheritance

**Partnership:**
- You're jointly and severally liable for partnership debts
- Your estate can be pursued for debts incurred by your partners
- Extreme risk

**Company (Pty Ltd):**
- The company is liable, not you personally
- UNLESS you've given personal guarantees for loans, leases, or supplier credit
- Check what you've personally guaranteed

**Trust:**
- The trustee is liable (which might be you personally)
- Depends on the trust deed and how the trust is structured

### How to protect your family

1. **Review all personal guarantees**
   - Business loans
   - Lease agreements
   - Supplier credit accounts
   - Bank overdrafts

2. **Try to remove personal guarantees**
   - Negotiate with lenders
   - Provide alternative security
   - Use company guarantees instead

3. **Use life insurance**
   - Cover business debts you've guaranteed
   - Ensure your family isn't left with debt

4. **Separate business and personal assets**
   - Don't use personal assets as business security
   - Operate through proper structures
   - Keep clear boundaries

## Valuing your business for estate purposes

Your business needs to be valued for several reasons:
- Tax purposes (capital gains tax calculations)
- Equal distribution among beneficiaries
- Buy-sell agreement payouts
- Probate asset listings

<div class="australia-note">
  <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2">

    <path d="M12 8v4M12 16h.01"/>
  </svg>
  <div>
    <h4>Australian Tax Office Valuations</h4>
    <p>The ATO has strict rules about business valuations. You can't just pick a number. Valuations must be based on acceptable methods (market value, net asset value, capitalisation of earnings, discounted cash flow). Get a professional valuation for tax purposes.</p>
  </div>
</div>

### Common valuation methods

**Asset-based valuation:**
- What the business assets are worth if sold
- Works for businesses with significant tangible assets
- Often undervalues service businesses

**Earnings multiple:**
- Business profit × industry multiple
- Common for small businesses
- Multiples vary by industry (2-5× for most small businesses)

**Discounted cash flow:**
- Future earnings discounted to present value
- Complex but accurate for established businesses

### The valuation trap

Your business might be worth different amounts to different people:
- **Going concern value:** What it's worth if it keeps operating
- **Liquidation value:** What assets fetch if sold separately
- **Market value:** What a third party would pay
- **Value to you:** What income stream it provides

**Example: The phantom value**

Marcus thought his IT consulting business was worth $500,000 (3× annual profit). His will left it to his son.

After Marcus died, they tried to sell the business. Buyers offered $100,000. Marcus's personal client relationships and technical expertise couldn't be transferred. What looked valuable was just Marcus.

The business was worth $500,000 with Marcus, $100,000 without him.

## Tax implications

Business owners face unique tax issues on death.

### Capital Gains Tax (CGT)

When you die, you're deemed to have disposed of your business assets at market value. This can trigger CGT.

**The problem:**
- Large tax bill on death
- Estate must pay before distributing to beneficiaries
- Can force sale of the business to pay tax

<div class="australia-note">
  <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2">
    <circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/>
    <path d="M12 8v4M12 16h.01"/>
  </svg>
  <div>
    <h4>Small Business CGT Concessions</h4>
    <p>Australia has generous small business CGT concessions. If your business qualifies (generally under $2 million turnover or $6 million net asset value), you may be able to reduce or eliminate CGT on death. Concessions include: 15-year exemption, 50% active asset reduction, retirement exemption, and small business rollover relief. Speak to an accountant about structuring your business to access these concessions.</p>
  </div>
</div>

### Accessing small business concessions

**Requirements** (simplified):
- Business turnover under $2 million OR
- Net asset value under $6 million
- Asset must be an "active asset" (used in the business)

**Potential result:**
With proper planning, zero CGT on business transfer to family members.

**The catch:**
Complex rules. Requires advance planning. Not automatic.

## Final thought

Your business represents years of work, sacrifice, and expertise. It deserves better than to be an afterthought in your estate plan.

The business owners who successfully transfer their businesses don't do it by accident. They plan for years. They structure properly. They train successors. They fund buyouts. They address tax. They communicate with family.

And they do it while they're healthy and in control — not on their deathbed when options are limited.

Start planning today. Your business, your family, and your legacy deserve it.
