# Who Do You Really Trust?

Writing a will forces you to answer a question most of us avoid: *Who do I really trust?*

Not who you love. Not who you're supposed to trust. Not who would be offended if you didn't choose them.

Who do you *actually* trust - with your money, your decisions, your children, your legacy?

For some people, the answer comes easily. For many, it doesn't. And that's okay. In fact, it's normal.

This is one of the biggest reasons people put off making a will. Not the paperwork. Not the cost. The confrontation. Having to look honestly at your relationships and answer questions you've been avoiding - that's the hard part. And most people would rather not.

## The Uncomfortable Truth

Here's what nobody tells you about writing a will: the hardest part isn't dividing your assets. It's confronting the reality of your relationships.

You might realise:

- You love your partner deeply, but don't trust them to manage money
- You adore your children equally, but only one is responsible enough to be executor
- Your siblings would be hurt not to be chosen, but you haven't spoken properly in years
- The person you trust most is too old, too unwell, or too far away
- You don't have anyone. Not really.

These realisations can sting. They can bring up grief, disappointment, even shame.

But here's the comfort: **you're not alone, and you're not wrong to feel this way.**

Trust is complicated. Families are complicated. And a will is simply a document that asks you to be honest about both.

## Trust Is Not Love

Let's be clear about something: trust and love are not the same thing.

You can love someone completely and not trust them with certain responsibilities. That's not a betrayal - it's wisdom.

- You might love your brother but know he's hopeless with paperwork
- You might love your daughter but know she'd crumble under pressure
- You might love your parents but know they're not capable of raising young children again

Choosing someone for a role in your will isn't a measure of how much you love them. It's a practical decision about capability, availability, and yes - trust.

**The most loving thing you can do is choose the right person, not the person who expects to be chosen.**

## What Trust Actually Means

When you appoint someone in your will or power of attorney, you're trusting them with something specific. It helps to break it down:

**Executor** - You're trusting them to:
- Handle paperwork and bureaucracy
- Make fair decisions under pressure
- Deal with banks, lawyers, and government
- Manage family emotions (including their own)
- Follow your wishes, even when it's hard

**Financial Attorney** - You're trusting them to:
- Manage your money if you can't
- Pay your bills, handle your accounts
- Not take advantage of you when you're vulnerable
- Make decisions you would make

**Medical Attorney** - You're trusting them to:
- Make life-and-death decisions on your behalf
- Understand your values, not impose their own
- Stand firm under pressure from doctors or family
- Let you go, if that's what you would have wanted

**Guardian** - You're trusting them to:
- Raise your children as their own
- Love them through grief and confusion
- Make thousands of daily decisions for years
- Be there, completely, when you can't be

When you see it written out like that, it's no wonder the decision feels heavy.

## The Hard Questions

If you're struggling to know who to trust, try sitting with these questions. You don't need to answer them immediately. Just let them breathe.

**For your executor:**
- If I told them something was important to me, would they remember?
- Can they handle conflict without crumbling or exploding?
- Would they put my wishes above their own convenience?
- Can they be fair to people they don't personally like?

**For your financial attorney:**
- Have I ever seen them handle money under stress?
- Do they have their own financial life in order?
- Would they spend my money the way I would spend it?
- Could they say no to a family member asking for my money?

**For your medical attorney:**
- Do they actually know what I would want?
- Can they separate their feelings from my wishes?
- Would they fight for me - and would they let me go?
- Can they handle a hospital, a doctor, a crisis?

**For a guardian:**
- Would my children feel safe with them?
- Do they share my values - or at least respect them?
- Is their life stable enough to absorb this responsibility?
- Would they speak well of me to my children?

There are no perfect answers. But there are honest ones.

## When You Don't Have Anyone

Some people sit down to write a will and realise they don't have someone they trust for every role. Maybe for any role.

This is more common than you might think. People move countries, lose touch with family, outlive their close friends, or simply have small circles.

If this is you, please hear this: **you are not a failure. You are not unloved. You are simply facing a practical problem that has practical solutions.**

Options include:

- **Professional trustees** - Public Trustee offices and private trustee companies can act as your executor. They're impartial, experienced, and don't have family politics.
- **Paid attorneys** - Lawyers and accountants can be appointed as financial attorneys.
- **Younger family** - A niece, nephew, or cousin you trust, even if you're not close, might be honoured to be asked.
- **Friends** - There's no rule that says it has to be family.
- **Multiple people** - You can appoint two people jointly, so they keep each other honest.

Having no obvious person doesn't mean you can't make a will. It means you need to be a bit more creative. And that's okay.

## The Conversation Nobody Wants to Have

Once you know who you trust, there's another hard part: telling them.

And sometimes, harder still: *not* telling someone who expected to be chosen.

Some thoughts on this:

**Talk to the people you're appointing.** Don't surprise them after you're gone. Being an executor or attorney is a significant responsibility. They deserve to know - and to say no if it's too much.

**You don't owe anyone an explanation for not choosing them.** Your will is not a popularity contest or a family ranking system. If someone is hurt, that's understandable - but it doesn't mean you made the wrong choice.

**Some things don't need to be said directly.** If your brother asks why he wasn't chosen as executor, you don't have to say "because you're irresponsible with money." You can simply say "I thought about what would be easiest for everyone, and this felt right." That's enough.

**The discomfort now prevents bigger problems later.** A hard conversation today is better than a family war after you're gone.

## Trust Can Change

Here's something that might bring comfort: **you're not locked in forever.**

The people you trust today might not be the right people in ten years. Relationships shift. People grow - or don't. Circumstances change.

Your will should be a living document that reflects your life as it actually is, not as it was when you first wrote it.

If you've appointed someone and later realise they're not the right choice - that's okay. Update your will. No guilt required.

Trust is not a promise you made once. It's a judgement you're allowed to revise.

---

## A Gentle Reminder

Writing a will can stir up all sorts of feelings. Grief for relationships that aren't what you hoped. Fear about the future. Loneliness. Regret.

If this process is bringing up difficult emotions, that's not a sign you're doing it wrong. It's a sign you're doing it honestly.

Take your time. Put it down if you need to. Come back when you're ready.

**The goal isn't to finish quickly. The goal is to finish truthfully.**

And when you do - when you've looked honestly at your relationships and made your choices - you'll have done something profound. You'll have taken care of the people you love, with clarity and intention.

That's not just a legal document. That's an act of love.

## What Trust Looks Like in a Will

In the end, a will is simply a written record of your trust.

- *I trust this person to sort out my affairs.*
- *I trust this person to make decisions if I can't.*
- *I trust this person to raise my children.*
- *I trust these people to receive what I've built.*

The document itself is straightforward. The trust behind it - that's the hard-won part.

So if you're sitting here, wrestling with who you really trust, know this:

**You're doing the real work. And it matters.**
