## Australia: Kitteridge v Kitteridge (2022)

**Citation:** [2022] NSWSC 193  
**Court:** Supreme Court of New South Wales  
**Key Issues:** Estrangement, multiple wills, divorce impact on children, moral duty

### The Story

Brenda May Kitteridge died in NSW leaving a will that gave virtually her entire estate to her youngest son Steven, who was also named executor. Her two older sons, Lee and Robert, received nothing.

The will contained a pointed clause:

> *"I have made no provision for my sons ROBERT KITTERIDGE and LEE KITTERIDGE as they have refused to have any contact with me for many years."*

But the backstory was far more complicated than this statement suggested.

### The Background

Brenda had been through a bitter divorce from her husband decades earlier. After the separation, her son Lee took in his father, who lived with Lee for many years. The two maintained a close relationship.

Brenda identified Lee with her resentment toward her ex-husband. In her mind, Lee had chosen his father over her. She felt abandoned and betrayed.

The estrangement deepened dramatically when Lee testified *against* his mother in a family provision claim she brought against her own parents' estates. After that court case, all contact between Brenda and Lee stopped completely. Brenda never met her grandchildren—Lee's children.

Meanwhile, Steven maintained a close relationship with his mother. They shared interests, owned property together in the Blue Mountains, and he cared for her in her later years.

### The Documentation Trail

Brenda was meticulous about documenting her reasoning. Over her lifetime, she made **seven different wills**, each progressively reducing or eliminating provision for Lee and Robert.

She also left **nine written statements**—both typed and handwritten—explaining why she was cutting them out. These statements consistently referenced Lee's perceived abandonment and his alignment with his father.

Brenda clearly anticipated a challenge. Her will explicitly stated her wish that the executors defend any claim from her sons.

### The Legal Challenge

Despite more than 40 years of estrangement, Lee brought a family provision claim under the Succession Act 2006 (NSW), seeking a significant share of the estate.

The key question for the court: Does a parent's moral duty to provide for their children survive decades of estrangement?

### The Court's Analysis

Justice Robb examined the **cause** of the estrangement—not just its existence.

The court found something crucial: **Brenda herself had provoked the estrangement** by forcing her children into an impossible position during the divorce. She had demanded they choose between their parents.

Justice Robb made significant observations about what contemporary community standards expect from divorcing parents:

> *"Parents engaged in bitter marriage breakdowns should be expected to:*
>
> *(a) spare their children from the need to choose between their parents;*
>
> *(b) understand the likelihood that children are likely innocently to suffer emotional injury from the breakdown; and*
>
> *(c) recognise that when a child is forced to make an unsatisfactory choice between parents, the parents should take responsibility to break down emotional barriers created by the parents' conduct and not rely upon the child to do so."*

The court held that because Brenda had created the conditions for the estrangement—and had made no effort to repair the relationship herself—her moral duty to provide for Lee remained intact.

### The Outcome

Despite **seven wills** and **nine written statements** explaining her reasons for disinheritance, Brenda's wishes were overridden.

Lee was awarded **$460,000** from the estate. The residue went to Steven, the favoured son.

### Key Lessons

1. **Writing reasons for disinheritance isn't bulletproof.** Even meticulous documentation across seven wills didn't prevent the claim succeeding. Courts look beyond the words to the underlying circumstances.

2. **Who caused the estrangement matters enormously.** If the will-maker provoked or contributed to the breakdown, courts are far more likely to award provision to the estranged child.

3. **Divorced parents can't force children to choose sides.** Courts now explicitly expect parents to take responsibility for repairing relationships they damaged through divorce conflict.

4. **The size of the estate matters.** The court noted the "substantial size" of the estate as a factor—larger estates make it easier to award provision without causing undue hardship to other beneficiaries.

5. **Wealth from family provision claims can come back around.** Brenda's estate largely came from successfully contesting *her own parents'* estates. That wealth was then successfully contested by her son.

6. **Contemporary community standards evolve.** What might have been accepted 40 years ago (forcing children to choose between parents) is now viewed as a failure of parental duty.

### Relevance for Estate Planning

This case demonstrates that even the most thorough documentation of reasons for disinheritance may not protect a will from challenge. The court will examine:

- The true cause of any estrangement
- Whether the will-maker contributed to the breakdown
- Whether any efforts were made at reconciliation
- The financial circumstances of the claimant
- The size of the estate
- Competing claims from other beneficiaries

A well-drafted will should address these factors honestly, not just state conclusions about the relationship.

## Canada: Tom v Tang (2023)

**Citation:** 2023 BCCA 221  
**Court:** Court of Appeal for British Columbia  
**Key Issues:** Last-minute will changes, rewarding caregivers, "judicious parent" standard, family contribution

### The Story

In the 1960s, Mr. and Mrs. Tom immigrated to Vancouver from Hong Kong with their five children, aged 8 to 17. They arrived with almost nothing—refugees building a new life.

The court noted that *"all members of the family worked remarkably hard, contributing whatever they earned to the common family purse."* Every family member played a role in building the family's modest success.

Over decades, the family prospered. By the time Mrs. Tom was elderly, she had an estate worth approximately **$2.3 million**, with the primary asset being the Vancouver family home valued at **$1.7 million**.

### The Close Family

Unlike many will dispute cases, this wasn't a story of estrangement or dysfunction. All five children remained devoted to their mother throughout her life.

The court found that *"all five children were dutiful and devoted to their mother, visiting or calling regularly, taking her to appointments, dim sum and social activities, staying with her when she needed support and visiting her when she was at the hospital and later in hospice."*

For years, Mrs. Tom's will reflected this closeness—it provided equally for all five children.

### The Last-Minute Change

Two of her daughters, Rose and Samsun, had become her primary caregivers for the last three years of her life. They lived with her and provided hands-on daily care.

**Seven days before her death**, Mrs. Tom decided to change her will dramatically.

She instructed her lawyer to prepare a new will that would leave approximately **85% of the estate** to Rose and Samsun (primarily by giving them the family home). The other three children would each receive only **5%**.

Mrs. Tom wrote a letter explaining her reasoning—she wanted to reward Rose and Samsun for their exceptional care and sacrifice.

### The Lawyer's Warning

Importantly, Mrs. Tom's lawyer **explicitly warned her** that such a disproportionate distribution could result in a successful wills variation claim. The lawyer explained that courts in BC have the power to vary wills that don't make adequate provision for children.

Mrs. Tom understood the risk and proceeded anyway. She was determined to recognise what Rose and Samsun had done for her.

### The Legal Challenge

After Mrs. Tom's death, the three children receiving only 5% each challenged the will under Section 60 of the Wills, Estates and Succession Act (WESA).

Importantly, they didn't argue that Rose and Samsun deserved nothing extra. They **agreed** that preferential treatment was warranted given the caregiving. What they disputed was **the magnitude** of the difference—a 17:1 ratio between the favoured daughters and the others.

### The Trial Decision

At trial, Justice Edelmann varied the will significantly. He ordered that Rose and Samsun each receive a gift of $300,000, and then the remainder of the estate would be divided equally among all five children.

Rose and Samsun appealed.

### The Court of Appeal's Analysis

The BC Court of Appeal had to resolve a long-standing legal question that had created uncertainty in will variation cases.

Previous cases (Hall v Hall, Bell v Roy, Kelly v Baker) had suggested that if a will-maker's reasons for unequal treatment were "valid and rational"—meaning true and logically connected to the decision—courts should generally defer to those reasons.

But this seemed to conflict with the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in Tataryn v Tataryn Estate, which said courts must apply an **objective standard** of what a reasonable will-maker would do.

Justice Fenlon, writing for the Court of Appeal, clarified:

> *"[These cases] do not stand for the principle that a testator's unequal treatment of adult children must be deferred to, without regard to the objective standard of the reasonable testator and current social norms, as long as the subjective reasons given for the unequal distribution are valid and rational."*

In other words: **having valid and rational reasons isn't enough.** Even if your reasons are true and logical, you must still meet the standard of what an "objectively judicious parent" would do.

### Applying the Standard

The court acknowledged that Mrs. Tom's reasons were valid—Rose and Samsun genuinely had provided exceptional care. But a reasonable parent in Mrs. Tom's position would consider:

- All five children had contributed to building the family's success over decades
- All five maintained loving, supportive relationships with their mother
- None of the three was estranged or guilty of any misconduct
- The difference between 85% and 5% was extreme

An objectively judicious parent would recognise the caregivers' contribution while still acknowledging the moral claims of all five children.

### The Outcome

The Court of Appeal partially allowed the appeal but still varied the will. The final distribution:

- **Rose and Samsun: 30% each** (60% total)
- **The other three children: 13.33% each** (40% total)

This represented a significant shift from both Mrs. Tom's intended 85%/15% split and the trial judge's more equal division.

### Key Lessons

1. **Last-minute will changes are inherently vulnerable.** Changing your will seven days before death, especially with dramatic differences from previous wills, invites scrutiny and challenge.

2. **"Valid and rational" doesn't mean "legally protected."** Your reasons can be completely true and logically connected to your decision, but still fail to meet the objective standard of a judicious parent.

3. **Listen to your lawyer's warnings.** Mrs. Tom was explicitly told this distribution would likely be challenged. She proceeded anyway, and the prediction came true.

4. **Rewarding caregivers is legitimate, but proportion matters.** Courts accept that children who provide care deserve greater provision. But a 17:1 ratio (85% vs 5%) was deemed excessive.

5. **Historical family contribution creates ongoing moral obligations.** All children had contributed to building the family's wealth—that created moral claims that didn't disappear just because they weren't the primary caregivers in the final years.

6. **Document your reasoning, but don't expect it to be determinative.** Mrs. Tom wrote a letter explaining her wishes. It was considered, but it didn't prevent variation.

### Relevance for Estate Planning

This case has significant implications for anyone considering unequal provision among children:

- If you want to favour one child over others, document your reasons clearly
- Be realistic about the limits—courts may reduce extreme disparities
- Consider whether your distribution would seem reasonable to an objective outsider
- Remember that courts will consider all children's contributions and relationships, not just recent caregiving
- A moderate preference for caregivers (like 60/40) is more likely to survive challenge than an extreme one (like 85/15)

## UK: Rea v Rea (2024)

**Citation:** [2024] EWCA Civ 169  
**Court:** Court of Appeal of England and Wales  
**Key Issues:** Undue influence, burden of proof, caregiving relationships, marathon litigation

### The Story

Anna Rea made her first will in 1986, shortly after divorcing her husband. It was straightforward: her estate would be divided equally among her four children—daughter Rita and three sons (Remo, Rocco, and Rodolfo).

For nearly **30 years**, this will stood unchanged.

Then, in **December 2015**, at age 85, Anna made a dramatic new will. The house—the main asset in her estate—would go entirely to Rita. The three sons would share only the residue, receiving about 25% each of a much smaller pot.

The 2015 will contained a declaration of Anna's reasons:

> *"[My sons] have not cared for me... should any of my sons challenge my estate I wish my executors to defend any such claim as they are not dependent on me, and I do not wish for them to share in my estate save what I have stated in this Will."*

Anna died in July 2016, aged 85. Her sons weren't told about the 2015 will during her lifetime—they only discovered it after her death.

### The Background

Rita had moved in with Anna in 2009 after Anna suffered a heart attack. For six years, Rita acted as her mother's primary caregiver, providing daily support and companionship.

The sons, meanwhile, had limited contact with their mother. Anna felt they had abandoned her. Whether this perception was fair or not, it was genuinely held.

The 2015 will wasn't impulsive—Anna met with a solicitor, Ms Batson, who assessed her capacity. Her GP, Dr Qaiyum, had also seen her around this time. Both professionals found Anna to be capable and clear-minded.

### The Challenge Begins

When the sons discovered the 2015 will, they challenged it on every available ground:

1. **Lack of testamentary capacity** — claiming Anna wasn't mentally capable
2. **Lack of knowledge and approval** — claiming she didn't understand what she was signing
3. **Undue influence** — claiming Rita coerced her
4. **Fraudulent calumny** — claiming Rita "poisoned" Anna against them

### The Marathon Litigation

What followed was **eight years and five rounds of litigation**—one of the most protracted will disputes in recent UK history:

**Round 1 - High Court (2019):**  
All claims dismissed. The judge found Anna had capacity, knew what she was doing, and wasn't unduly influenced. Will valid.

**Round 2 - High Court Appeal (2021):**  
The sons appealed. Appeal dismissed.

**Round 3 - Court of Appeal (2022):**  
The sons appealed again. This time, they succeeded—but only on procedural grounds. The Court of Appeal felt that Rita's evidence hadn't been sufficiently scrutinised at trial. The case was sent back for a retrial.

**Round 4 - High Court Retrial (July 2023):**  
At the retrial, a different judge (HHJ Hodge KC) took a different view. While he dismissed the capacity, knowledge, and fraudulent calumny claims, he found that **undue influence had been proven**. He ruled the 2015 will invalid.

Rita appealed.

**Round 5 - Court of Appeal (February 2024):**  
The Court of Appeal overturned the retrial decision, finding the judge had fundamentally misunderstood the law of undue influence. Will valid.

### The Court of Appeal's Analysis

Lord Justice Newey, delivering the lead judgment, clarified what undue influence actually requires:

> *"For coercion to be proved, it had to be shown to be more probable than any other possibility."*

The judge at retrial had listed various factors he considered indicative of undue influence:

- Anna was "frail and vulnerable"
- Rita had a "forceful personality" and "forceful physical presence"
- Anna was dependent on Rita
- Rita arranged the meeting with the solicitor
- The timing coincided with Rita moving in

But the Court of Appeal systematically dismantled each factor:

**On frailty and vulnerability:**  
Being elderly and needing care doesn't mean you're being coerced. Many elderly people make valid wills while receiving care.

**On forceful personality:**  
*"People with forceful personalities do not routinely, let alone invariably, exercise undue influence."* Having a strong character isn't evidence of wrongdoing.

**On dependency:**  
The care Rita provided for six years *"could very plausibly have led [Anna] to wish to make particular provision for [her], without being subject to any undue influence."*

**On arranging the solicitor meeting:**  
*"This was a very common request from elderly parents."* Helping your elderly mother see a solicitor isn't suspicious.

**On the professional evidence:**  
The trial judge had essentially ignored the evidence of Dr Qaiyum (Anna's GP) and Ms Batson (the solicitor). Both found no signs of coercion. Both were deemed reliable witnesses. The Court of Appeal found this evidence should have carried significant weight.

**On Anna's own behaviour:**  
Anna had rejected some of Rita's suggestions and changed her instructions when Rita wasn't present. This showed her own free will was engaged—she wasn't simply doing whatever Rita wanted.

### The Key Legal Principle

The Court of Appeal emphasised that undue influence in will cases requires proof of **coercion**, not merely influence or persuasion:

> *"The circumstances must be such that undue influence is more probable than any other hypothesis. If another possibility is just as likely, undue influence will not have been established."*

In this case, the other possibility—that Anna simply wanted to reward the daughter who had devoted six years to caring for her, while feeling abandoned by her sons—was at least equally likely, if not more so.

### The Outcome

The 2015 will was finally admitted to probate. Rita kept the house. 

Eight years of litigation ended exactly where it started—with the will Anna intended.

### The Cost

While the exact legal costs weren't published, five rounds of High Court and Court of Appeal litigation over eight years would have consumed an enormous portion of the estate. The "winners" likely received far less than if the matter had settled early or not been contested at all.

### Key Lessons

1. **Undue influence is extremely hard to prove.** Five rounds of litigation ultimately failed. The legal test requires showing coercion was "more probable than any other hypothesis"—a very high bar.

2. **Professional witnesses are crucial.** The GP and solicitor both saying they saw no coercion was decisive evidence. If you're making a will that might be challenged, having independent professionals confirm your capacity and free will is invaluable.

3. **Document independence of thought.** Anna rejected some of Rita's suggestions and made changes when Rita wasn't present. This demonstrated she was thinking for herself, not just following orders.

4. **Caring for an elderly parent creates legitimate expectations.** Courts recognise that dedicated caregivers have genuine moral claims to greater provision. This isn't suspicious—it's natural.

5. **Forceful personality ≠ undue influence.** Strong-willed people can help elderly relatives without coercing them. The law doesn't penalise family members for being assertive.

6. **Marathon litigation destroys estates and families.** Eight years of fighting benefited no one except the lawyers. Even the "winner" lost years of peace and probably a significant portion of the inheritance to legal fees.

7. **Persuasion is not coercion.** Family members are allowed to suggest, encourage, and even lobby for certain outcomes. That's normal family dynamics. Undue influence requires something more—overpowering the testator's own will.

### Relevance for Estate Planning

This case provides guidance for both will-makers and potential beneficiaries:

**For will-makers:**
- If you're changing your will significantly, especially late in life, see a solicitor independently
- Have your GP or another medical professional confirm your capacity around the same time
- If someone is helping you, demonstrate you can think independently (reject some suggestions, make changes when they're not present)
- Document your reasons in your own words

**For beneficiaries:**
- If you're helping an elderly relative with their will, don't be present during the actual consultation
- Encourage them to see professionals independently
- Keep records showing their independent decision-making
- Don't be afraid to have a strong personality—but don't isolate them from other family members

## New Zealand: The Alphabet Case (2024)

**Citation:** Various proceedings involving pseudonymous parties  
**Court:** Supreme Court of New Zealand  
**Key Issues:** Trust avoidance, abusive parents, claw-back provisions, law reform

### The Story

This case involved children known only as "Alice," "Barry," and "Cliff"—hence the nickname "The Alphabet Case." Their father was referred to as "Robert."

Robert had subjected his children to **egregious abuse** during their childhoods. The details weren't published, but the courts consistently described the abuse as severe. The children had no ongoing relationship with their father—understandably so.

Robert knew that when he died, his children might bring claims against his estate under the Family Protection Act 1955. This Act allows family members to challenge wills that don't make adequate provision for their maintenance and support.

### The Avoidance Scheme

Robert decided to ensure there would be nothing to claim. During his lifetime, he transferred virtually all his assets into a **discretionary trust**. Crucially, none of his children were beneficiaries of that trust.

When Robert died, his estate was essentially empty. The assets existed, but they were locked inside the trust—technically not part of his estate.

### The Legal Challenge

Alice, Barry, and Cliff wanted to bring claims under the Family Protection Act for provision from their father's estate. The problem was obvious: there was nothing in the estate.

They mounted an innovative legal argument. They claimed that Robert owed them **fiduciary duties** as their parent, and that he breached those duties by abusing them. They argued this breach should allow the court to effectively "claw back" the assets from the trust—treating them as if they were still part of his estate.

This raised a fundamental question: **Can you use a trust to deliberately avoid your moral obligations to your children?**

### The Supreme Court Decision

The case went all the way to New Zealand's highest court, the Supreme Court.

The children's argument was creative but ultimately unsuccessful. The court found it couldn't simply disregard the trust structure and treat the assets as estate property.

The trust was validly established. The transfer of assets was completed during Robert's lifetime. Whatever moral duties Robert may have owed his children, the legal structure he created was effective at defeating their claims.

**The abusive father's scheme worked.**

### The Law Commission Response

The case exposed a significant gap in New Zealand's succession law.

Unlike Australia (particularly NSW), New Zealand doesn't have strong "notional estate" provisions. In NSW, courts can designate assets that were transferred out of an estate—including assets in trusts—as "notional estate" available to meet family provision claims. New Zealand law has no equivalent power.

The **New Zealand Law Commission** reviewed this issue as part of its comprehensive review of succession law. In its 2021 report, the Commission recommended that future legislation should include **anti-avoidance provisions**—allowing courts to look through trusts that were deliberately set up to defeat legitimate family claims.

The Commission noted that the current law fails to protect vulnerable family members from deliberate avoidance tactics.

### The Current State

As of 2024, the New Zealand government has considered the Law Commission's report but has **not yet progressed legislative reform**. 

This means trusts remain an effective shield against family provision claims in New Zealand. A parent who wants to disinherit their children can do so by transferring assets to a trust during their lifetime—even if those children are victims of the parent's abuse.

### Key Lessons

1. **Trusts can defeat family provision claims in New Zealand.** Unlike Australia, New Zealand courts currently struggle to look through trust structures established before death.

2. **Abusive parents can legally disinherit their victims.** This case exposed a serious gap in the law. The moral duty to provide for children—even children you've abused—can be avoided through careful structuring.

3. **Timing matters.** Assets transferred to trusts well before death are particularly difficult to challenge. If Robert had tried to establish the trust on his deathbed, the outcome might have been different.

4. **Law reform is needed but slow.** The Law Commission flagged this problem clearly, but legislative change hasn't followed. Reform takes time, and in the meantime, the gap persists.

5. **New Zealand differs significantly from Australia.** In NSW, courts have broad powers to designate "notional estate" from assets transferred before death. This includes trust assets in some circumstances. New Zealand has no equivalent.

6. **Creative legal arguments don't always succeed.** The fiduciary duty argument was innovative, but the courts weren't willing to extend the law that far without legislative backing.

### Relevance for Estate Planning

**For New Zealand will-makers:**
This case confirms that trusts are a powerful tool for controlling the distribution of wealth, including avoiding family provision claims. However:
- This approach may become less effective if law reform proceeds
- There are ethical considerations in using trusts to defeat legitimate claims
- Trust structures should be established well before death to be most effective

**For potential claimants in New Zealand:**
- If assets have been moved to a trust, your options are currently limited
- Early legal advice is essential—there may be other avenues to explore
- Keep informed about potential law reform that could change the landscape

**For Australian comparison:**
Australia (particularly NSW) takes a different approach:
- Courts can designate "notional estate" including certain trust assets
- Assets transferred for less than full value may be clawed back
- The time limits and conditions vary, so professional advice is essential

## Bonus: Historical Cases with Good Lessons

### Canada: The Great Stork Derby (1926-1936)

Charles Vance Millar, a Toronto lawyer and notorious practical joker, died in 1926 leaving one of history's most bizarre wills.

The bulk of his fortune would go to whichever Toronto woman gave birth to the **most children in the 10 years following his death**.

What followed was called "The Great Stork Derby"—a decade-long contest that became a media sensation. It coincided with the Great Depression, making the prize even more desperately sought.

**The complications:**
- What counted as "Toronto"? City limits were disputed.
- Did stillbirths count?
- What about children born out of wedlock? (Ruled: they didn't count)
- What about children fathered by someone other than the mother's husband?

After massive litigation, four women with nine children each shared the prize: $110,000 each (equivalent to $2.24 million in 2023 dollars). Two other women received $12,500 each to settle their disputed claims.

**Lesson:** Write clear, unambiguous wills. Don't create contests. Specify your intentions precisely.

### UK: Marley v Rawlings (2014)

Mr. and Mrs. Rawlings made mirror wills—identical documents leaving everything to each other, then to Terry Marley (a man they treated as a son, though not legally adopted).

When their solicitor visited to have them sign the wills, he accidentally handed each spouse the wrong document. **They signed each other's wills.**

Mrs. Rawlings died first. Her estate passed to her husband without the error being noticed.

When Mr. Rawlings died, the error was discovered. His biological sons (who'd been cut out) argued the will was invalid because he'd signed his wife's document, not his own. Under intestacy rules, they would inherit everything.

The case went all the way to the **UK Supreme Court**—the first wills case ever heard by that court.

**The decision:** The Supreme Court ruled the will could be "rectified" (corrected) because it was a "clerical error." Terry Marley got the estate as intended.

**Lesson:** Always check your will before signing. Simple errors can cause years of litigation.

---

### UK: The Ostrich Eggshell Will (1926)

Boat pilot John Barnes left a formal will distributing his estate between his second wife and children. After his death, his wife discovered an ostrich eggshell inscribed with: *"Mag. Everything I possess. J. B."*

The handwriting matched Barnes'. But the court ruled it couldn't be accepted as a valid will—it didn't meet the formal requirements.

**Lesson:** Wills must comply with legal formalities. Creative formats don't work.

---

### USA/International: Leona Helmsley's Dog (2007)

Hotel billionaire Leona Helmsley left **$12 million** to her Maltese dog, Trouble, while disinheriting two grandchildren *"for reasons known to them."*

The grandchildren challenged the will on grounds of mental incapacity. A judge reduced Trouble's inheritance to $2 million and gave $6 million to the grandchildren.

**Lesson:** Extreme bequests to pets invite challenge. Reasonable provision for pet care is fine; $12 million is excessive.

---

### New Zealand: Thomas Cawthron's Moral Clause (1915)

Thomas Cawthron left his solicitor's sister an annuity with an unusual condition—it would *"absolutely cease for ever"* if she *"gets married or has sexual intercourse with any man."*

The reasons behind this clause were never explained.

**Lesson:** Conditions that attempt to control beneficiaries' personal lives may be challenged as contrary to public policy. Courts have increasingly struck down conditions that unreasonably restrict marriage or personal choices.

## Key Takeaways for Estate Planning

### For Will-Makers

1. **Document your reasons, but don't rely on documentation alone.** Courts will look behind your stated reasons to examine the true circumstances.

2. **Be realistic about unequal distribution.** Moderate preferences (60/40) are more likely to survive than extreme ones (85/15).

3. **Consider the cause of any estrangement.** If you contributed to a family breakdown, courts may find your moral duty persists despite the estrangement.

4. **Get independent professional advice.** Having a solicitor and/or doctor confirm your capacity and independence is valuable protection.

5. **Demonstrate independent thinking.** Make some decisions when potential beneficiaries aren't present. Reject some suggestions. Show you're thinking for yourself.

6. **Update your will regularly, not just at the end.** Last-minute changes invite scrutiny.

### For Potential Claimants

1. **Estrangement doesn't automatically bar claims.** Courts will examine who was responsible for the breakdown.

2. **Undue influence is very hard to prove.** You need evidence of actual coercion, not just influence or a strong personality.

3. **Consider the cost of litigation.** Marathon court battles can consume the estate you're fighting over.

4. **Act promptly.** Time limits apply in all jurisdictions—usually 12 months from death or grant of probate.

5. **Get early legal advice.** The strength of your claim depends heavily on the specific facts of your situation.

### For Executors

1. **Expect challenges if the will is unusual.** Unequal distributions, late changes, or exclusions of close family members often trigger disputes.

2. **Preserve evidence.** Keep records of the will-maker's capacity, independence, and stated reasons.

3. **Don't distribute too quickly.** Wait for time limits to expire before making final distributions.

4. **Consider mediation.** Court battles are expensive and damaging. Early settlement often benefits everyone.
