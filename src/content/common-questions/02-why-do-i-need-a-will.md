Most people don’t avoid making a will because they think it’s unimportant.
They avoid it because life feels busy, unfinished, or not “serious enough yet”.

The reason a will matters is simple: life rarely waits until things feel neat.

A will isn’t really about dying.
It’s about what happens after — for the people you leave behind.

Without a will, decisions are still made.
They’re just made by rules and assumptions that don’t know your relationships or priorities.

A will replaces assumptions with clarity.
It helps people act with confidence instead of hesitation.

It doesn't need to be perfect.
It just needs to reflect your intentions right now.
