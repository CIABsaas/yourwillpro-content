Not everything you own is necessarily covered by your will.

Some assets pass outside a will, such as jointly owned property, superannuation, or assets with a nominated beneficiary. These are transferred according to different rules.

Your will usually controls assets held solely in your name that do not have another binding arrangement in place.

Understanding what your will does and does not cover helps prevent surprises for those you leave behind.
