## Probate explained simply

Probate is the court's official stamp of approval on a will. It confirms:

1. The will is valid
2. The person named as executor has legal authority to act
3. The estate can be administered according to the will

Without probate, banks, registries, and other institutions may refuse to release assets.

## Why probate exists

Probate protects everyone:

- **Beneficiaries** — Ensures the will is genuine and valid
- **Creditors** — Gives time to make claims against the estate
- **Institutions** — Provides legal cover for releasing assets
- **Executors** — Confirms their authority to act

It's a safeguard against fraud, forgery, and mistakes.

## The probate process

**Step 1: Apply to the court**

The executor lodges:
- The original will
- A death certificate
- An application form
- Details of the estate's assets and liabilities
- Filing fee

**Step 2: Court reviews**

The court checks:
- The will appears valid
- Proper signing and witnessing
- No obvious issues or challenges

**Step 3: Grant issued**

If everything's in order, the court issues a "Grant of Probate" — a legal document confirming the executor's authority.

**Step 4: Executor acts**

Armed with the grant, the executor can:
- Access bank accounts
- Sell property
- Transfer assets
- Deal with institutions on behalf of the estate

## When probate is required

Probate is typically needed when the estate includes:

- Real estate (land and buildings)
- Shares or substantial investments
- Bank accounts above certain thresholds
- Assets held in the deceased's sole name

## When probate may not be needed

Probate often isn't required for:

- **Small estates** — Under $50,000–$100,000 (varies by institution)
- **Joint assets** — Pass automatically to surviving owner
- **Super and life insurance** — Paid directly to nominated beneficiaries
- **Assets already in trust** — Managed by the trustee

## Probate costs

| State | Court fee (approximate) |
|-------|------------------------|
| NSW | $0–$1,500 depending on estate value |
| VIC | $380–$800+ |
| QLD | $0–$900 |
| WA | $310–$900+ |
| SA | $150–$700+ |
| TAS | $100–$600+ |

Plus legal fees if you use a lawyer (often $1,500–$5,000 for straightforward estates).

## Probate timeline

- **Simple estates:** 4–8 weeks after application
- **Average estates:** 2–4 months
- **Complex estates:** 6+ months
- **Contested estates:** 1–3 years or more

The court's workload, estate complexity, and any disputes all affect timing.

## Probate vs Letters of Administration

| Situation | Document issued |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Valid will exists | Grant of Probate |
| No will (intestate) | Letters of Administration |
| Will exists but no executor available | Letters of Administration with Will Annexed |

Same process, different names depending on circumstances.

## Can probate be challenged?

Yes. Grounds for challenge include:

- The will wasn't properly signed or witnessed
- The will-maker lacked mental capacity
- Fraud or undue influence
- A later will exists
- Family provision claims (not enough left to dependants)

Challenges can significantly delay the process.

## What to do next

**If you're an executor:**
1. Locate the original will
2. Obtain death certificates (multiple copies)
3. List all assets and liabilities
4. Check which institutions require probate
5. Consider whether to DIY or use a lawyer
6. Lodge the application
