If you have children from a previous relationship and a current partner, the standard approach ("everything to my spouse") might leave your children with nothing.

**The risk:** If you leave everything to your partner, they control what happens next. When they die, their will decides where it goes — and your children may not be included.

**Common strategies:**

**Life interest:** Your partner can live in the house or receive income, but the asset passes to your children when they die.

**Direct gifts:** Leave specific assets or amounts directly to your children, with the rest to your partner.

**Testamentary trust:** Assets are held in trust with rules about who benefits and when.

**What to discuss with your partner:**
- What do your children need?
- What does your partner need?
- What happens if your partner remarries?

**The hard truth:** Without explicit planning, blended families often end up in court. Your will is the only way to protect children from a previous relationship.
