Pressure to change a will is more common than people think. It can be subtle ("You know I've always been here for you") or overt.

**Warning signs:**
- Someone insists on being present when you discuss your will
- You feel guilty or obligated to include/exclude someone
- A family member is managing your affairs and pushing for changes
- You're being isolated from other family

**What to do:**
- See a solicitor alone, without family present
- Take your time — don't be rushed
- Tell your solicitor if you feel pressured
- Ask for a capacity assessment if you're concerned about your own clarity

**If you've already changed your will under pressure:**
- You can change it again
- Speak to a solicitor privately
- The most recent valid will is the one that counts

**After you die:**
- If someone can prove you were pressured, your will could be overturned
- This is called "undue influence" and it's grounds for a challenge

**Your will should reflect what you want — full stop.**
