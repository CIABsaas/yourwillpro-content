## Why parents resist

Before you push harder, understand what's behind the resistance:

**"I don't want to think about death"**
Many people avoid anything that reminds them of mortality. It feels morbid or brings up fear.

**"It's none of your business"**
Talking about money with children can feel like an invasion of privacy or an invitation to conflict.

**"I'll get to it eventually"**
Procrastination is human. There's always something more urgent.

**"Everything will go to your mother/father anyway"**
They may not understand that intestacy rules can be complicated, especially for blended families.

**"I don't have enough to worry about"**
Even small estates benefit from a will — it simplifies everything.

**"The government/lawyers just take it all"**
This is a myth. A will actually makes things cheaper and smoother.

## How to start the conversation

**Don't make it about their death**

Frame it as practical planning:
- "I'm making my own will and it made me think..."
- "I want to make sure I can help you if anything happens..."
- "My friend's family went through a difficult time because..."

**Make it about them helping you**

- "I wouldn't know what to do if something happened. Can we talk about your wishes?"
- "I want to make sure I respect what you want."
- "It would give me peace of mind to know your plans."

**Focus on what matters to them**

- If they value fairness: "A will makes sure things are divided the way you want."
- If they worry about conflict: "A clear will prevents fights between siblings."
- If they have grandchildren: "Do you want to leave anything directly to the grandchildren?"
- If they're practical: "It saves time and money for everyone."

## What if they still say no?

**Accept their right to decide**

Ultimately, it's their choice. Pressuring too hard can damage your relationship.

**Plant seeds**

Share articles, mention stories of families affected by dying without a will, talk about your own planning. Let the ideas percolate.

**Ask specific questions**

Even without a formal will, knowing their wishes helps:
- "If something happened, would you want to stay at home or go to care?"
- "Where are your important documents?"
- "Who should I call first?"

**Focus on what you can control**

- Ensure you know where important documents are kept
- Understand their financial situation (roughly)
- Know their wishes for medical care
- Have your own affairs in order

## Practical concerns to raise

Sometimes concrete problems resonate more than abstract ones:

- **"Who will be in charge?"** Without a will, the court decides who administers the estate.
- **"How will the house be handled?"** Property can get complicated without clear instructions.
- **"What about your pet/car/collection?"** Specific items they care about.
- **"What if [sibling] and I disagree?"** A will provides a decision-maker and clear instructions.

## What happens if they die without a will

<div class="australia-note">
<p><strong>🇦🇺 In Australia:</strong> Intestacy rules determine who inherits. Generally, spouse first, then children. But blended families, long-lost relatives, or estranged children can complicate things.</p>
</div>

**Possible consequences:**

- Delays in accessing funds (months, sometimes years)
- Higher legal costs
- Family conflict over who gets what
- Assets going to people they wouldn't have chosen
- No say in who manages the estate

Sharing these realities — gently — might motivate action.

## When capacity is a concern

If your parent's mental capacity is declining, time is critical.

- A will made without capacity can be challenged
- Powers of Attorney become essential
- The window to act legally may be closing

If you're concerned:
- Encourage action while they're clearly capable
- Consider involving their doctor if needed
- Seek legal advice about capacity requirements

## Involving professionals

Sometimes parents listen to professionals more than family:

- **Financial adviser** — Can raise estate planning naturally
- **Lawyer** — Adds authority and formality
- **Accountant** — Especially if tax planning is relevant
- **Doctor** — Can discuss advance care directives

A professional's involvement also removes the sense that children are "after something."

## What to do next

1. Reflect on why they're resisting
2. Choose the right moment for a calm conversation
3. Make it about their wishes, not your inheritance
4. Accept their decision if they refuse — but keep the door open
5. Focus on what you can learn and prepare regardless
6. Seek professional help if capacity is a concern
