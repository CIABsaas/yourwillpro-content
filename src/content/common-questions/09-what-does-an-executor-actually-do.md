In real life, an executor’s role is practical rather than legal.

They locate the will, deal with banks and organisations, pay debts and expenses, apply for probate if required, and arrange for the estate to be distributed according to the will.

Executors do not decide who receives what. Their role is to follow instructions and manage the process so things happen in the right order.

Clear records and instructions make this role much easier.
