In many situations, beneficiaries do not pay tax simply for receiving an inheritance.

However, tax can apply in specific circumstances, such as income earned from inherited assets, capital gains on certain property, or superannuation death benefits.

The tax outcome often depends on the type of asset, how it is transferred, and what happens after it is received. The executor usually manages any tax obligations that arise during estate administration.

Knowing this distinction helps separate concerns about inheritance from concerns about future financial decisions.
