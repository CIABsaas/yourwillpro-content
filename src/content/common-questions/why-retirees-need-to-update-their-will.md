quickAnswer: "The will you made while working probably doesn't reflect your retirement reality. Downsizing, super drawdowns, grandchildren, and changing family dynamics all mean it's time for a fresh look."

## Retirement is a trigger event

If your will was made before retirement, it's probably out of date. Retirement brings changes that affect your estate:

- Assets are different (super drawdown, pension, downsizing proceeds)
- Your family structure has likely changed (grandchildren, divorced children, new relationships)
- Your wishes may have evolved
- Your chosen executor may no longer be appropriate

A will review at retirement is as important as a health check.

## Your assets have changed

Pre-retirement, your assets might have been:
- A home with a mortgage
- Superannuation accumulating
- Maybe some savings

Post-retirement, you likely have:
- A paid-off home (or different property after downsizing)
- Super in pension phase (different tax rules apply)
- Cash from downsizing
- Possibly inheritance from your own parents
- Different investment structures

## Grandchildren considerations

For many retirees, grandchildren change everything:

- Do you want to leave anything directly to grandchildren?
- Should gifts be held in trust until they're older?
- How do you treat grandchildren fairly if your children have different numbers of kids?
- What about step-grandchildren from your children's relationships?

Your original will probably didn't anticipate these questions.

## Children's circumstances change

Your adult children's lives have evolved:

- Some may be financially comfortable, others struggling
- Marriages, divorces, new partners
- Their own children (your grandchildren)
- Health issues or disabilities
- Business successes or failures

You might want to treat children differently based on their needs — or ensure inheritances are protected from divorcing spouses.

## Executor review

The executor you chose decades ago:
- Are they still alive and healthy?
- Are they still willing and able?
- Are they significantly older than you? (Not ideal)
- Do they have the skills for a potentially complex estate?

Retirement is a good time to reconsider executor appointments and have fresh conversations.

## Super in retirement

If your super is now in pension phase:

<p><strong>🇦🇺 In Australia:</strong> Reversionary pension nominations (where your pension continues to a surviving spouse) need to be set up correctly. If your spouse dies first, you'll need to update these arrangements. Check with your super fund.</p>
</div>

Also consider:
- Are your binding nominations current?
- Who gets remaining super when you die?
- Tax implications for beneficiaries

## Powers of Attorney become crucial

In retirement, the risk of losing capacity increases. Make sure you have:

- **Enduring Power of Attorney (Financial)** — For someone to manage your money
- **Enduring Power of Attorney (Medical) / Advance Care Directive** — For health decisions

These should be updated alongside your will. Old documents might name people who are no longer appropriate or available.

## Aged care considerations

If aged care is a possibility:
- Understand how your assets affect aged care costs
- Consider whether gifting now affects aged care assessments
- Plan for the possibility of one spouse in care while the other isn't
- Ensure your Power of Attorney covers aged care decisions

## Charitable giving in retirement

Many retirees want to support causes they care about:
- Leaving a percentage of your estate to charity
- Specific gifts to particular organisations
- Establishing a charitable fund
- Memorial donations

This is only possible through your will.

## What to do now

1. Find your current will and read it carefully
2. List what's changed since it was made — assets, family, wishes
3. Review your super arrangements and nominations
4. Update your Powers of Attorney
5. [Use our Preparation Checklist](/planning-tools/checklists/preparation) to organise everything
6. Make a new will that reflects your retirement reality
7. Have conversations with your family about your intentions
