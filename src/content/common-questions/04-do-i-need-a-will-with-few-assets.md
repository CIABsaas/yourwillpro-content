This is one of the most common reasons people delay a will.
If life feels simple and assets are modest, it’s easy to assume a will wouldn’t change much.

A will isn’t about how much you have.
It’s about reducing guesswork.

It matters the moment:
- more than one person could reasonably expect something
- someone would need authority to act
- decisions could otherwise be delayed

Clarity doesn't scale with wealth.
It scales with relationships.

As discussed earlier, it's often the absence of direction — not the size of an estate — that causes the most difficulty.
