## Divorce doesn't erase your will

Many people assume that divorce automatically cancels their will. It doesn't — not entirely.

<div class="australia-note">
<p><strong>🇦🇺 In Australia:</strong> In most states, divorce revokes any gift to your ex-spouse and removes them as executor. But the rest of your will remains valid. If your ex was your main beneficiary, you now have a will that might not make sense anymore.</p>
</div>

## What actually happens

After divorce, your existing will typically:

- ✅ Remains valid overall
- ❌ Any gifts to your ex-spouse are revoked (treated as if they died before you)
- ❌ Their appointment as executor is revoked
- ⚠️ Backup beneficiaries (if named) receive those gifts instead
- ⚠️ If no backup was named, those gifts may fall into the residuary estate

## The backup beneficiary surprise

Here's a common scenario:

> Your old will says: "I leave everything to my spouse, or if they predecease me, to my children."

After divorce, this becomes: "I leave everything to my children."

That might be fine — or it might not. What if:
- Your children are minors with no trust provisions?
- You wanted to provide for a new partner?
- You've promised things to other family members?
- Your financial situation has completely changed?

## Your ex might still benefit

Even though your ex is removed as a direct beneficiary, they might still benefit indirectly:

- **Through your children** — If minor children inherit, and your ex has custody, they effectively control the money
- **Through shared assets** — Joint accounts or investments might not be covered by your will
- **Through super** — If you never updated your super nomination, your ex might still be listed

## Super is separate from your will

Your superannuation has its own beneficiary nomination, and divorce doesn't automatically change it.

Check your super fund immediately. If your ex is still listed:
- Update your binding death benefit nomination
- Consider nominating your estate (then your will controls it)
- Or nominate specific people directly

## What about your new partner?

If you've moved on to a new relationship:

- Your old will probably doesn't mention them at all
- They'll have no automatic claim to your estate
- They may be able to make a family provision claim, but that's expensive and uncertain
- The safest approach is a new will that clearly provides for them

<div class="warning-box">
<p><strong>⚠️ Warning:</strong> If you're living with a new partner without updating your will, you're leaving their future security to chance and the courts.</p>
</div>

## Children need clear protection

Divorce often means your children live primarily with one parent. If you die:

- **Guardianship** — If both parents were alive, the other parent usually gets custody regardless of your will. But you can express wishes.
- **Financial protection** — A testamentary trust can ensure your children benefit from their inheritance, even if your ex controls their daily life.
- **Trustees** — Consider appointing someone other than your ex to manage your children's inheritance.

## Separation vs divorce

If you're separated but not yet divorced, your situation is more complex:

- Your spouse is likely still entitled to inherit under intestacy rules
- Gifts in your will to your spouse are still valid
- Making a new will during separation is strongly recommended
- But be aware it could be challenged if you die before divorce is finalised

## What to do after divorce

1. **Find your current will** — Read it carefully
2. **Check your super nominations** — Update immediately if needed
3. **List what's changed** — New partner? New assets? New wishes?
4. **Make a new will** — One that reflects your life now
5. **Update Powers of Attorney** — Remove your ex if they're named
