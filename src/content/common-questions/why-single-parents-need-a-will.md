## You're the whole safety net

For two-parent families, there's a backup if one parent dies. As a single parent, you're it. If something happens to you:

- Who raises your children?
- Who manages money on their behalf?
- Where do they live?
- How is their education funded?

Without a will, these decisions fall to the courts and intestacy laws — not to you.

## Guardian appointment is critical

The most important thing a single parent's will does is nominate a guardian for minor children.

<div class="australia-note">
<p><strong>🇦🇺 In Australia:</strong> Your will can nominate a testamentary guardian, but the Family Court makes the final decision based on the child's best interests. Your clearly expressed wishes carry significant weight — but only if you've written them down.</p>
</div>

Without a nomination:
- The court decides with no guidance from you
- Family members may fight over custody
- The outcome might be someone you'd never choose

## The other parent question

If your children's other parent is alive, they generally have a legal right to custody regardless of what your will says. But consider:

- **If they're a good parent** — Your will can still appoint a guardian in case they also die
- **If they're absent** — Your nominated guardian has a stronger claim
- **If they're unsuitable** — Document your concerns and nominate someone you trust

You can include a letter with your will explaining why you've chosen your guardian and any concerns about alternatives.

## Money needs protection too

Children can't legally inherit directly until they're 18. Without proper planning:

- Their inheritance goes into a court-controlled trust
- Or the other parent may gain control of it
- Funds might be spent before your children are old enough to benefit

A testamentary trust in your will lets you:
- Choose who manages the money (the trustee)
- Set conditions for how it's used (education, health, housing)
- Decide when children get full control (18, 21, 25, or in stages)

## Life insurance considerations

As a single parent, life insurance is essential. But the payout needs to go to the right place:

- **Nominate your estate** — Then your will controls distribution
- **Or nominate a trust** — Your testamentary trust can receive the payout
- **Don't nominate minor children directly** — They can't receive it, causing complications

Make sure your insurance and will work together.

<div class="tip-box">
<p><strong>💡 Important:</strong> Review your life insurance amount. As a single parent, it needs to cover not just debts but years of raising your children — childcare, education, housing, daily expenses.</p>
</div>

## Talk to your chosen guardian

Before you name someone in your will:

1. Ask if they're willing to take on the role
2. Discuss your parenting wishes and values
3. Talk about practical matters (where children would live, schools)
4. Consider their age, health, and financial situation
5. Have a backup guardian in case your first choice can't serve

## What to include in your will

As a single parent, your will should:

- ✅ Nominate a guardian (and backup guardian)
- ✅ Establish a testamentary trust for children's inheritance
- ✅ Name a trustee to manage the money (doesn't have to be the guardian)
- ✅ Set out how funds should be used for children's benefit
- ✅ Specify when children receive their inheritance outright
- ✅ Include a letter of wishes with parenting guidance

<div class="warning-box">
<p><strong>⚠️ Don't wait:</strong> As a single parent, you don't have a backup. Tomorrow isn't guaranteed. The best gift you can give your children is the security of knowing they'll be cared for.</p>
