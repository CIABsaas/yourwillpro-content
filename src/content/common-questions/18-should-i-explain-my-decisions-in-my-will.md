If you're leaving unequal shares or excluding someone, you might feel you should explain. But be careful where.

**Don't put reasons in the will:**
- Your will becomes public after probate
- Reasons can be misinterpreted or cause hurt
- Explanations can sometimes be used against the will in court

**Consider a separate letter:**
- Write a personal letter to be read after your death
- Explain your thinking and your love
- This isn't legally binding but can provide closure

**When explanation helps:**
- Unequal distributions between children
- Excluding someone who expected to inherit
- Leaving significant amounts to charity or friends

**When to stay silent:**
- The explanation could be hurtful without being helpful
- You'd rather your actions speak for themselves

**The goal:** Reduce confusion and resentment, not create ammunition for disputes.
