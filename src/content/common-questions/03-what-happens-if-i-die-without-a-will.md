When someone dies without a will, their wishes aren’t considered — not because they don’t matter, but because they were never recorded.

This is known as dying intestate.
In practice, it means fixed rules decide what happens instead of personal intention.

The law determines:
- who manages the estate
- who receives assets
- the order in which people are considered

These rules are neutral.
They don’t know your relationships, history, or priorities.

A will doesn't remove emotion, but it can provide direction.
Without it, even simple situations can take longer and feel harder than expected.
