A will isn't "set and forget." Life changes, and your will should keep up.

**Update when:**
- You get married (marriage usually revokes existing wills)
- You divorce or separate
- You have children or grandchildren
- A beneficiary or executor dies
- You buy or sell major assets
- Your relationships change significantly
- You move interstate (laws differ by state)

**Even if nothing changes:**
- Review every 3-5 years
- Check that executors are still appropriate and willing
- Make sure your wishes still reflect your values

**Signs your will is outdated:**
- It mentions assets you no longer own
- Named people have died or relationships have changed
- It was made before a major life event

**The risk of not updating:**
- Gifts fail if the person has died
- Executors may be unable or unwilling to act
- Disputes become more likely
