In most Australian states, divorce automatically affects your will:

**What typically happens:**
- Gifts to your former spouse are revoked
- Appointments of your former spouse as executor are revoked
- The rest of your will remains valid

**What doesn't change:**
- Separation (without divorce) has no automatic effect
- Your ex may still be able to make a family provision claim
- If your ex was your only beneficiary, your estate may pass under intestacy rules

**Caution:**
- If you separate but don't divorce, your spouse may still inherit
- Divorce doesn't update beneficiaries on superannuation or insurance — you must do that separately

**What to do after divorce:**
- Make a new will as soon as possible
- Update beneficiaries on super, insurance, and any trusts
- Consider whether your ex should remain as guardian if you have children

**Don't assume you're covered:** Divorce removes your ex from your will, but it doesn't create a new plan. You need to do that yourself.
