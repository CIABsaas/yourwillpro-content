## Why signing matters so much

Your will can have perfect content and still be invalid if it's not signed correctly. Courts see improperly signed wills regularly — and families suffer the consequences.

The good news: the rules aren't complicated. Follow them exactly.

## The basic requirements

For a valid will in Australia, you need:

1. **Your signature** — At the end of the will
2. **Two witnesses** — Adults who watch you sign
3. **Witnesses sign** — In your presence and each other's presence
4. **All present together** — Everyone in the same room at the same time

<div class="warning-box">
<p><strong>⚠️ Critical:</strong> All three people must be physically present together when signing. You cannot sign first, then have witnesses sign later. Everyone signs in one sitting.</p>
</div>

## Step-by-step signing process

**Step 1: Gather your witnesses**
Find two adults. They should NOT be:
- Beneficiaries named in the will
- Married to or in a relationship with a beneficiary
- Under 18 years old

Good choices: neighbours, colleagues, friends who aren't in the will.

**Step 2: Everyone in the same room**
All three of you must be present together throughout the entire signing process.

**Step 3: You sign first**
Sign at the end of the will (on the signature line) while both witnesses watch.
- Use your normal signature
- Sign in pen (blue or black ink)
- Sign every page if indicated (some wills require this)

**Step 4: Witnesses sign**
Each witness signs while you and the other witness watch.
- They sign in the spaces provided
- They should print their name and address clearly
- Both must sign at the same time you're present

**Step 5: Date the will**
Add the date. This establishes when the will was made.

## State-specific rules

<div class="australia-note">
<p><strong>🇦🇺 In Australia:</strong> Most states have similar rules, but some variations exist. NSW and QLD have slightly different witnessing requirements. When in doubt, follow the strictest interpretation.</p>
</div>

## Common mistakes that invalidate wills

❌ **Witness is a beneficiary** — They lose their gift, or the whole will fails

❌ **Witnesses not present together** — Will may be invalid

❌ **Signed in the wrong place** — Must be at the end

❌ **Only one witness** — Need two adults

❌ **Witness signed later** — All signatures must happen in one session

❌ **Video call witnessing** — Not valid in most states (changed during COVID but reverted)

## What about changes after signing?

Never:
- Cross out sections and initial
- Write additions in margins
- Use correction fluid
- Add handwritten notes

Any changes after signing should be done by either:
- Making a codicil (a formal amendment document)
- Creating a new will (usually better)

## After signing

1. Store the original safely (not in a bank safe deposit box — hard to access after death)
2. Tell your executor where to find it
3. Keep a copy for yourself
4. Don't staple, clip, or attach anything to the original

<div class="tip-box">
<p><strong>💡 Pro tip:</strong> Some people ask their witnesses to also sign a statement confirming they saw the will-maker sign and that they appeared to understand what they were doing. This is called an "attestation clause" — most wills include one.</p>
</div>

## What if something went wrong?

If you realise your will wasn't signed correctly:
- Make a new will with proper signing
- The old, improperly signed will is likely invalid
- Courts can sometimes validate informal wills, but don't rely on this

## What to do next

1. Prepare your will document completely before the signing session
2. Choose appropriate witnesses (not beneficiaries)
3. Schedule a time when all three can meet
4. Follow the steps above exactly
5. Store the signed original safely
