## The short answer

For an uncontested, straightforward estate:
- **Application preparation:** 2–4 weeks
- **Court processing:** 4–8 weeks
- **Total:** 2–3 months

But that's just the probate grant — not the entire estate administration.

## Probate timeline breakdown

**Stage 1: Preparation (2–4 weeks)**

Before you can apply, you need:
- Original will
- Death certificate (can take 1–2 weeks)
- Full list of assets and values
- Application forms completed
- Filing fee

**Stage 2: Lodging (1 day)**

Submit your application to the probate registry in the relevant state.

**Stage 3: Processing (4–8 weeks)**

The court:
- Reviews the application
- Checks for any caveats (objections)
- Verifies the will meets legal requirements
- Issues the grant if satisfied

**Stage 4: Receiving the grant (1 week)**

Once approved, the grant is issued and sent to you.

## What slows probate down

| Issue | Added time |
|-------|------------|
| Missing original will | Weeks to months |
| Incorrect application | 2–4 weeks to fix |
| Court backlog | 2–6 weeks |
| Caveat lodged | Months to resolve |
| Will validity questioned | 6–18 months |
| Family provision claim | 12–36 months |
| Complex estate | Variable |

## State-by-state estimates

These are typical timeframes for straightforward applications:

| State | Processing time |
|-------|----------------|
| NSW | 6–8 weeks |
| VIC | 4–6 weeks |
| QLD | 4–6 weeks |
| WA | 4–8 weeks |
| SA | 4–6 weeks |
| TAS | 3–5 weeks |
| ACT | 4–6 weeks |
| NT | 3–5 weeks |

Times fluctuate based on court workload.

## Probate vs estate administration

Probate is just one step. The full estate timeline:

| Stage | Timeframe |
|-------|-----------|
| Funeral and immediate tasks | 1–2 weeks |
| Gather documents, prepare application | 2–4 weeks |
| Probate processing | 4–8 weeks |
| Collect assets | 2–6 months |
| Pay debts and taxes | 2–6 months |
| Wait for claims period | 6–12 months |
| Final distribution | After above |

**Total: 6–18 months** for most estates.

## Can you speed up probate?

**Yes, if you:**
- Have all documents ready before applying
- Use correct forms and complete them accurately
- Pay the correct fee
- Avoid errors that require resubmission
- Use a lawyer familiar with the process

**Expedited applications** are possible for urgent matters:
- Perishable assets
- Business requiring immediate decisions
- Urgent financial hardship
- Property sales at risk of falling through

You'll need to justify the urgency to the court.

## What happens while waiting

You can still:
- Secure and maintain property
- Collect mail and documents
- Notify institutions of the death
- Prepare for asset collection
- Pay urgent bills from your own funds (to be reimbursed)

You generally cannot:
- Access bank accounts
- Sell property
- Distribute assets
- Make major decisions about estate assets

<div class="tip-box">
<p><strong>💡 Pro tip:</strong> Start gathering information before probate is granted. Contact banks, super funds, and insurers to understand what they need. That way you can act quickly once the grant arrives.</p>

## When probate takes years

Probate itself doesn't take years — disputes do.

**Family provision claims:** If someone challenges that they weren't adequately provided for, the matter goes to court. Settlement or trial can take 1–3 years.

**Will validity challenges:** If someone claims the will is invalid (forgery, capacity issues, undue influence), litigation can extend for years.

**Complex assets:** Overseas property, business interests, or assets in dispute can add significant time.

## What to do next

1. Start gathering documents immediately
2. Order multiple death certificates (you'll need them)
3. Identify all assets and their values
4. Check your state's probate registry for current forms
5. Consider whether to use a lawyer
6. Apply as soon as you have everything ready
