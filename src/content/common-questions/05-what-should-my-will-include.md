Most wills focus on a small number of decisions.

At its core, a will usually covers:
- who is responsible for carrying things out
- who should receive what you leave behind
- any specific instructions that matter to you

More detail can help in situations where there are children from previous relationships, dependants with specific needs, or arrangements that might be misunderstood.

A will doesn't need to solve every future scenario.
It needs to provide direction.

Understanding this usually makes the task feel smaller — and more manageable — than people expect.
