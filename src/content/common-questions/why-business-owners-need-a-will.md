quickAnswer: "Without proper planning, your business could collapse when you die — leaving employees without jobs, debts unpaid, and your family fighting over what's left. A will (plus business succession planning) keeps everything running."

## A business isn't like other assets

When you own a business, you're not just passing on an asset. You're dealing with:

- Employees who depend on you
- Customers expecting continuity
- Suppliers and creditors who need to be paid
- Contracts and obligations that don't stop when you die
- Potential value that can evaporate quickly without leadership

Without a plan, your business might not survive you.

## Business structure matters

What happens when you die depends on how your business is structured:

**Sole trader:**
- Business assets are personal assets
- Everything goes through your will
- Without someone to run it, the business may simply end
- Clients and contracts have no protection

**Partnership:**
- Check your partnership agreement — it should address death
- Without an agreement, the partnership dissolves
- Remaining partners may need to buy out your share
- Your estate might be owed money with no clear way to collect it

**Company (Pty Ltd):**
- Shares go through your will
- But directors control the company
- If you're the sole director, no one can legally act
- Shareholders and directors need succession planning

**Trust:**
- Trust assets don't go through your will
- Appointor and trustee succession is critical
- Your family might lose control of trust assets without proper planning

## Buy-sell agreements

If you have business partners, a buy-sell agreement is essential. This contract sets out:

- What happens to your share when you die
- How your share is valued
- Where the money comes from to buy out your share
- Whether partners are required or just allowed to buy

Combined with life insurance, a buy-sell agreement ensures your family gets fair value while your partners keep the business.

## Key person insurance

If your business relies heavily on you (and most do), consider key person insurance:

- Pays the business a lump sum if you die
- Helps cover losses while finding replacement
- Can fund recruitment, training, or debt repayment
- Gives the business breathing room

This is especially important if you're the main salesperson, relationship holder, or technical expert.

## Protecting employees

Good estate planning for business owners considers employees:

- Who takes over management?
- Can wages be paid during transition?
- Will the business continue or be sold?
- Are there key staff who might buy the business?

## Your family's interests

Your business might be your family's main asset, but they might not want to run it. Your will and business planning should consider:

- Do family members want to be involved?
- Should the business be sold? To whom?
- How do you treat family members equally if one works in the business?
- What about children who aren't ready for the responsibility?

## What should your will include?

For business owners, your will should address:

- ✅ Who inherits your business interest (shares, partnership interest, sole trader assets)
- ✅ Who has authority to run the business during estate administration
- ✅ How business debts are handled
- ✅ Whether beneficiaries can keep or must sell the business
- ✅ Any buy-sell agreements that override your will
- ✅ Instructions for your executor on business matters
