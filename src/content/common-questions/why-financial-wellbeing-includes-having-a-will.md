## Beyond budgets and savings

When people think about financial wellbeing, they usually think about:

- Paying off debt
- Building savings
- Investing wisely
- Retiring comfortably

All important. But there's a missing piece: what happens to all of it if you're not here?

A will completes your financial plan by ensuring everything you've worked for goes where you want it to go.

## Control is the foundation

Financial wellbeing isn't just about having money. It's about:

- **Security** — Knowing your family will be okay
- **Control** — Deciding what happens to your assets
- **Peace of mind** — Not worrying about the "what ifs"
- **Legacy** — Passing on what matters to you

A will gives you control over the biggest financial event your family will ever experience — receiving (or not receiving) what you leave behind.

## The cost of not having a will

Without a will:

**Financial costs:**
- Legal fees for administration are higher
- Court applications cost money
- Delays mean assets sit frozen while bills keep coming
- Family disputes cost everyone

**Opportunity costs:**
- Assets distributed by formula, not strategy
- Tax planning opportunities missed
- Super may go to the wrong people
- Your carefully built wealth gets scattered

**Emotional costs:**
- Family conflict and resentment
- Uncertainty during grief
- No clear direction for loved ones
- Your intentions never known

<div class="tip-box">
<p><strong>💡 Perspective:</strong> You spend time choosing investments, comparing interest rates, and tracking your super. Why leave the final distribution of all that effort to chance?</p>
</div>

## Part of a complete financial plan

A good financial plan includes:

- ✅ Budget and cash flow management
- ✅ Emergency fund
- ✅ Debt reduction
- ✅ Insurance protection
- ✅ Superannuation strategy
- ✅ Investment portfolio
- ✅ Retirement planning
- ✅ **Estate planning (including a will)**

Your financial adviser probably talks about all of these. If they don't mention estate planning, ask why not.

## Protection for your family

Financial wellbeing isn't just about you. It's about the people who depend on you:

- **Spouse/partner** — Will they have access to money immediately? Can they pay the mortgage?
- **Children** — Are they provided for? Is someone managing money for them?
- **Parents** — If you support them, who continues that support?
- **Business partners** — Is your share of the business protected?

A will is a safety net for everyone connected to you financially.

## Super and insurance alignment

Your super and life insurance are major financial assets. But they sit outside your will unless you coordinate them:

- **Super binding nominations** — Direct who receives your super
- **Life insurance beneficiaries** — Ensure alignment with your will
- **Income protection** — Who receives payments if you're disabled?
- **TPD insurance** — How does this fit your overall plan?

Financial wellbeing means all these pieces work together.

## The peace of mind dividend

There's a financial return to having your affairs in order:

- **Reduced stress** — You're not carrying an undone task
- **Confident decisions** — You know your family is protected
- **Better relationships** — Conversations about money become easier
- **Focus on living** — Less worry about what might happen

This is intangible but real. People with their affairs in order report higher financial confidence.

## What complete financial wellbeing looks like

- You know what you have
- You know where it's going
- Your family knows what to do
- Documents are up to date
- Everything aligns — will, super, insurance
- You've had the important conversations

It's not complicated. It just takes a bit of time and intention.

## What to do now

1. Add "make/update will" to your financial to-do list
2. Review your super binding nominations
3. Check life insurance beneficiaries
4. Have a conversation with your partner about finances
5. [Use our Preparation Checklist](/planning-tools/checklists/preparation) to organise your information
6. Make a will that completes your financial plan
7. Set a reminder to review annually

<p><strong>💡 One step:</strong> If your will is the only undone item in your financial plan, it's the most important one to complete. Everything else you've built is at risk without it.</p>
