## The guardian question

The most important thing your will does: appoint a guardian for your minor children.

Without this:
- Family members may fight over custody
- The court decides with no guidance from you
- Your children might end up with someone you wouldn't choose
- Siblings could be separated

<div class="australia-note">
<p><strong>🇦🇺 In Australia:</strong> A testamentary guardian (named in your will) looks after your children if both parents die. The Family Court makes the final decision based on the child's best interests, but your nomination carries significant weight.</p>
</div>

## Choosing the right guardian

This is the hardest decision. Consider:

- **Values** — Will they raise your children the way you would?
- **Practical factors** — Location, space, stability
- **Existing relationships** — Do your children know and trust them?
- **Age and health** — Can they realistically take on young children?
- **Financial situation** — Are they stable?
- **Their own family** — Are they willing to add to their household?
- **Both parents' wishes** — Do you and your partner agree?

Most importantly: have you asked them? Never name someone without their consent.

## Protecting their inheritance

Children can't inherit directly until they're 18. Without a will:
- Their inheritance goes into a court-supervised trust
- There's less flexibility in how funds are used
- The surviving parent (or guardian) has limited control

With a testamentary trust in your will:
- You choose the trustee who manages the money
- You set rules for how funds can be used (education, health, housing)
- You decide when children receive their inheritance outright (18, 21, 25, or in stages)
- You protect their inheritance from poor decisions, divorce, or creditors

<div class="tip-box">
<p><strong>💡 Separate roles:</strong> The guardian raises your children. The trustee manages their money. These can be different people — choose each for the right reasons.</p>

## Life insurance is essential

Young children mean decades of financial need. If you die, who pays for:
- Housing
- Food and clothing
- Education (school, university)
- Healthcare
- Extracurriculars
- The life you wanted them to have

Calculate what your family needs, then get appropriate life insurance. Name your estate (or a trust) as beneficiary so your will controls distribution.

## The "both parents" scenario

Most planning assumes one parent survives. But what if you both die in an accident? Your will should cover:

- First choice guardian and backup
- What happens to the family home
- How life insurance proceeds are managed
- Whether siblings stay together
- Provision for children's varying needs as they grow

Have these difficult conversations with your chosen guardian.

## Letters of wishes

Your will is a legal document. A letter of wishes is personal guidance for your guardian:

- Your hopes for your children's education
- Values you want instilled
- Religious or cultural practices
- Family members you want them to stay connected with
- Practical information about routines, health, preferences
- Messages you want them to receive as they grow up

Not legally binding, but invaluable for the people raising your children.

## Update as children grow

Your will should evolve with your children:

- **Babies and toddlers** — Focus on guardian choice and care
- **School age** — Consider education funding
- **Teenagers** — Think about when they should control inheritance
- **Approaching 18** — Reassess whether testamentary trust still makes sense

Major life changes (yours or theirs) should trigger a review.

## What to do now

1. Discuss guardian options with your partner — you must agree
2. Have conversations with potential guardians — get their consent
3. Calculate life insurance needs — be realistic about costs
4. [Use our Guardian Checklist](/planning-tools/checklists/guardian) to organise your thinking
5. Make a will with guardian nominations and testamentary trust
6. Write a letter of wishes for your children and their guardian
7. Tell your family where to find everything

<div class="warning-box">
<p><strong>⚠️ Don't wait:</strong> No one expects to die young, but accidents happen. The best gift you can give your children is knowing they'll be safe and cared for.</p>
