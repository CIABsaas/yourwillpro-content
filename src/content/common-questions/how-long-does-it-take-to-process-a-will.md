## The typical timeline

For a straightforward estate, expect 6–12 months from death to final distribution. This might feel long, but there are good reasons.

## Estate administration phases

**Phase 1: Immediate steps (1–4 weeks)**
- Funeral arrangements
- Locate the will
- Notify key institutions
- Secure assets and property
- Apply for death certificates

**Phase 2: Information gathering (1–3 months)**
- Identify all assets and debts
- Value the estate
- Contact banks, super funds, insurers
- Determine if probate is needed

**Phase 3: Probate (1–4 months)**
- Prepare and lodge application
- Court reviews and grants probate
- Timeline varies by state and court backlog

**Phase 4: Collecting assets (2–6 months)**
- Present probate to institutions
- Close accounts and collect funds
- Sell property if required
- Collect debts owed to deceased

**Phase 5: Paying debts (6–12 months)**
- Pay funeral expenses
- Clear outstanding debts
- Lodge final tax returns
- Wait for creditor claim period to pass

**Phase 6: Distribution (after debts cleared)**
- Transfer assets to beneficiaries
- Establish any trusts
- Obtain releases from beneficiaries
- Close the estate

<div class="australia-note">
<p><strong>🇦🇺 In Australia:</strong> Executors typically wait 6–12 months before final distribution to allow time for any creditors or claimants to come forward. Distributing too early can leave the executor personally liable.</p>
</div>

## What can delay things

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Contested will | Months to years |
| Complex assets | Business, overseas property adds time |
| Missing documents | Have to reconstruct records |
| Family disputes | Negotiations slow everything |
| Tax complications | Waiting for ATO clearance |
| Property sale | Market conditions, settlement times |
| Multiple jurisdictions | Coordinating across states/countries |

## When probate isn't needed

Some assets can be accessed without probate:

- **Joint assets** — Pass automatically to the survivor
- **Super and life insurance** — Paid directly to nominated beneficiaries
- **Small bank accounts** — Some banks release small amounts without probate

If the estate consists mainly of these, administration can be much faster.

## What beneficiaries can expect

**Early on:**
- The executor should keep you informed of progress
- Don't expect immediate access to assets
- Some specific items may be distributed early if appropriate

**During administration:**
- Ask for updates but be patient
- The executor is balancing many demands
- Disputes among beneficiaries slow everything down

**Distribution:**
- Usually happens after all debts are cleared
- You may receive an interim distribution before final settlement
- Get a receipt or release document when you receive your inheritance

<div class="tip-box">
<p><strong>💡 Managing expectations:</strong> The executor isn't being slow — they're being careful. Rushing can create legal problems. If you're waiting on an inheritance, plan your finances assuming it will take at least 12 months.</p>
</div>

## Speeding things up (where possible)

Executors can help by:
- Starting paperwork promptly
- Gathering documents efficiently
- Using lawyers for complex matters
- Keeping beneficiaries informed
- Making decisions rather than delaying

Beneficiaries can help by:
- Responding quickly to requests for information
- Not creating unnecessary disputes
- Being patient and understanding
- Signing documents promptly when needed

## When delays are concerning

It's reasonable to ask questions if:
- You haven't heard anything for months
- The executor won't provide updates
- Years have passed with no explanation
- You suspect mismanagement

You can apply to the court if an executor isn't fulfilling their duties.
