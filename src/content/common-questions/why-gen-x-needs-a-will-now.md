quickAnswer: "Gen X typically has the most complex estates — mortgages, super, investments, ageing parents, and children at different life stages. Without a current will, you're leaving a mess for everyone."

## The sandwich generation squeeze

If you're Gen X (roughly 45-60), you're likely caught between:

- **Children** — Some still at home, some adults, some with their own kids
- **Ageing parents** — Who may need care or financial support
- **Peak assets** — Mortgage progress, super growth, investments accumulating
- **Career demands** — Less time to think about "what ifs"

This complexity is exactly why you need a will — and why a simple one from 10 years ago probably isn't enough anymore.

## Your estate has grown

Think about what's changed since you last looked at your will (or first thought about making one):

- Property values have increased significantly
- Your super balance has grown substantially
- You may have inherited from parents
- Investment portfolios have expanded
- Business interests may have developed

## Children at different stages

A will written when your kids were toddlers doesn't work when they're adults. Consider:

- **Minor children** — Still need guardians appointed and money held in trust
- **Young adults (18-25)** — Legally adult but may not be ready for a large inheritance
- **Adult children** — May have partners, debts, or circumstances you want to consider
- **Grandchildren** — Do you want to include them directly?

A testamentary trust can protect inheritances from divorce, bankruptcy, and poor decisions — regardless of your children's age.

## The blended family factor

Many Gen Xers are in second marriages or long-term relationships with children from previous partnerships. This creates questions:

- Does your current partner get everything?
- What about children from your first marriage?
- Are stepchildren included?
- What happens to the family home?

Without clear instructions, these situations often end up in court.

## Executor reality check

If you named your parents as executors years ago, it's time to reconsider. Are they still:
- Capable of managing a complex estate?
- Likely to outlive you?
- Willing to take on the responsibility?

Similarly, if you named a sibling or friend, have their circumstances changed?

## Ageing parents and your responsibilities

If you're supporting ageing parents financially or practically, what happens if you die first? Consider:

- Who continues their care?
- Are there funds set aside for their needs?
- Have you discussed this with siblings?

## What to do now

1. **Find your current will** — When was it made? Is it still accurate?
2. **Review your super nominations** — Are they current and binding?
3. **List your assets** — [Use our Asset Inventory Checklist](/planning-tools/checklists/asset-inventory)
4. **Consider a testamentary trust** — Especially with adult or nearly-adult children
5. **Update or create your will** — Don't let complexity be an excuse for inaction
