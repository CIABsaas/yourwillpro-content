## You have more than you think

Most millennials assume they don't have enough assets to worry about. But take a quick inventory:

- **Superannuation** — Even a few years of work means you've got super. For many millennials, it's their largest asset.
- **Digital assets** — Crypto, PayPal balances, online businesses, valuable social media accounts
- **Vehicles** — Cars, motorbikes, even e-bikes
- **Savings and investments** — Share trading apps, savings accounts, term deposits
- **Personal belongings** — Electronics, furniture, collectibles, jewellery

Without a will, all of this gets distributed according to intestacy laws — not your wishes.

## Super doesn't automatically go where you think

Here's something that surprises most people: your superannuation doesn't automatically form part of your estate.

<div class="australia-note">
<p><strong>🇦🇺 In Australia:</strong> Super funds have their own rules. Without a valid binding death benefit nomination, the fund's trustee decides who gets your super — and it might not be the person you'd choose.</p>
</div>

If you want your partner, parents, or siblings to receive your super, you need to:
1. Make a binding death benefit nomination with your super fund
2. Update it regularly (most expire after 3 years)
3. Ensure your will aligns with your super wishes

## The de facto trap

Many millennials are in long-term relationships without being married. While Australian law recognises de facto relationships, proving one after death can be complicated and expensive.

A will removes any doubt about your wishes and protects your partner from having to fight for what you'd want them to have.

## Digital assets need a plan

What happens to your:
- Cryptocurrency wallets
- Online business accounts
- Subscription services
- Cloud storage full of photos and documents
- Domain names and websites

Without instructions, these can be lost forever or inaccessible to your loved ones.

## It's not about dying — it's about control

Making a will doesn't mean you're planning to die soon. It means you're taking control of what happens to the things you've worked for.

<div class="tip-box">
<p><strong>💡 Quick win:</strong> An online will takes about 20 minutes and costs less than a night out. That's a small investment for peace of mind.</p>
