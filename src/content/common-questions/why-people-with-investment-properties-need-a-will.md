quickAnswer: "Investment properties don't get a CGT-free death uplift like your home does. Your beneficiaries inherit your cost base, meaning they could face significant CGT when they sell. Proper planning can minimise the tax burden."

## Investment properties are different

Unlike your family home (which is usually CGT-free), investment properties come with significant tax implications when you die:

- No CGT exemption or "death uplift" for beneficiaries
- Your cost base passes to your heirs
- All capital gains since you bought accumulate
- When they sell, they pay CGT on the full gain

<div class="australia-note">
<p><strong>🇦🇺 Example:</strong> You bought an investment property in 2000 for $300,000. When you die, it's worth $800,000. If your children inherit it, their cost base is $300,000 (plus some adjustments). If they sell for $800,000, they owe CGT on $500,000 in gains.</p>
</div>

## Ownership structure matters

How you own your investment properties affects what happens when you die:

**Joint tenants:**
- Property passes automatically to the surviving owner
- Bypasses your will
- Surviving owner's cost base stays the same
- No immediate CGT event

**Tenants in common:**
- Your share goes through your will
- You choose who inherits
- Beneficiary inherits your cost base for your share
- May need to work with remaining co-owners

**Company or trust:**
- Different rules apply
- Asset doesn't pass through your will
- Need succession planning for directors/trustees

## Multiple properties, multiple decisions

If you have several investment properties, consider:

- Do all beneficiaries get equal shares of all properties?
- Do specific properties go to specific people?
- Should any be sold and proceeds distributed instead?
- Who manages them during estate administration?
- Do any beneficiaries want to keep them?

## Rental income during administration

When you die, your investment properties still generate rent (and expenses). Your will should consider:

- Who receives the rental income during administration?
- Who pays the expenses (rates, insurance, maintenance)?
- How long might administration take?
- Should properties be sold quickly or held?

Your executor needs clear direction — and possibly access to funds to cover costs.

## Tenants and leases

Existing leases continue when you die:
- Tenants have rights that don't end
- Leases must be honoured
- Bond money must be properly handled
- Property management arrangements continue

Your executor steps into your shoes as landlord.

## Mortgages and debt

If your investment properties have mortgages:

- Who keeps making repayments during administration?
- Does insurance cover the debt if you die?
- Will beneficiaries need to refinance in their names?
- Can they afford to keep properties with existing loans?
- Should properties be sold to clear debt?

Your estate plan should ensure your family isn't trapped with debt they can't service.

## Tax planning strategies

Several strategies can help manage the tax burden:

**Leave properties to spouse:**
- They inherit at your cost base
- But CGT is deferred until they sell
- May be appropriate depending on their age and plans

**Use testamentary trusts:**
- Properties can be held in trust
- Rental income distributed tax-effectively
- Multiple beneficiaries can share income
- Flexibility for future decisions

**Consider selling before death:**
- You control timing and pay CGT
- Beneficiaries receive cash (no CGT for them)
- May be worthwhile if you have capital losses to offset
- Simpler for beneficiaries to manage

## Beneficiary considerations

Different beneficiaries have different tax situations:
- Adult children pay CGT at their marginal rate
- Spouse defers CGT until sale
- Trusts have special tax treatment
- Some beneficiaries may want property; others prefer cash

Your will can provide for different outcomes.

## What to do now

1. List all investment properties and their ownership structures
2. Understand your cost base for each (purchase price plus improvements and costs)
3. Estimate potential CGT for beneficiaries
4. Review how each property is financed
5. Consider whether structures should change
6. Decide which properties go to whom (or whether to sell)
7. Update your will to reflect these decisions
8. Get professional tax and estate advice
