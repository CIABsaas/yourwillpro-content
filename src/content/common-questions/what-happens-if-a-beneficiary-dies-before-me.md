If a beneficiary dies before you, what happens depends on how your will is written.

Some wills include substitution clauses, allowing the gift to pass to someone else, such as the beneficiary's children. Others may cause the gift to fall back into the estate.

Clear drafting helps ensure your intentions are carried out.
