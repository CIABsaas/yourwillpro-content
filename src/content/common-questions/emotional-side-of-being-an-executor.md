## It's more than paperwork

When someone names you as their executor, they're trusting you with their final wishes. That's an honour — but it comes during one of the hardest times of your life.

You're grieving while also being expected to make decisions, manage conflict, and handle legal responsibilities. That's a lot.

## What executors experience

**Grief and responsibility collide**

You can't fully grieve because there's work to do. But you can't fully focus on the work because you're grieving.

This tension is exhausting and completely normal.

**Family dynamics resurface**

Old tensions often emerge when money and possessions are involved. Siblings who haven't spoken in years suddenly have opinions. You're caught in the middle.

**Loneliness of the role**

Others can share their grief, but you carry the weight of decisions alone. You may feel like you can't complain because "it's your job."

**Second-guessing decisions**

"Would they have wanted this?" "Am I doing the right thing?" These questions can haunt you, especially when the will doesn't cover every detail.

<p><strong>💡 Remember:</strong> You weren't chosen because you're perfect. You were chosen because they trusted you. Do your best — that's all anyone can ask.</p>

## Common emotional challenges

| Challenge | What it feels like |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Resentment | "Why did they leave me this mess?" |
| Guilt | "I shouldn't feel angry at someone who died" |
| Overwhelm | "I don't know where to start" |
| Conflict | "Everyone blames me for decisions I have to make" |
| Isolation | "No one understands what I'm dealing with" |
| Burnout | "I can't keep doing this" |

All of these are normal. You're not failing — you're human.

## Coping strategies

**Accept imperfection**

You will make some decisions others disagree with. You may make mistakes. That's okay. Courts don't expect perfection; they expect honesty and reasonable effort.

**Set boundaries**

You don't have to answer calls at midnight. You don't have to justify every decision to every family member. Set office hours for estate matters if needed.

**Get support**

- Talk to a counsellor or therapist
- Connect with others who've been executors
- Join an online support group
- Lean on friends who aren't involved in the estate

**Separate grief from admin**

Block time specifically for estate work. Block other time for grieving. Don't try to do both at once.

**Accept help**

You can hire lawyers, accountants, and professional administrators. The estate pays for it. You don't have to do everything yourself.

## Dealing with family conflict

**Stay neutral**

Your job is to follow the will, not to be everyone's therapist or referee. Don't take sides.

**Communicate in writing**

Keep records. Send updates by email so everyone has the same information. This reduces "he said, she said."

**Be transparent**

Show beneficiaries the accounts, the timeline, the process. Transparency reduces suspicion.

**Don't take the bait**

Some people want to fight. You don't have to engage. "I understand you're upset. I'm following the will as written. Here's what happens next."

**Accept you can't please everyone**

Someone will be unhappy. That's not your fault. Your job is to execute the will faithfully, not to make everyone feel good.

## When to seek professional help

Consider talking to someone if you:

- Feel persistently overwhelmed or anxious
- Can't sleep or focus on normal life
- Feel intense anger or resentment
- Are neglecting your own health or relationships
- Think about giving up completely

Grief counselling is covered by some Employee Assistance Programs. Your GP can also refer you.

## What to tell beneficiaries

If you're struggling, it's okay to say:

> "This is a difficult process for all of us. I'm doing my best to handle the estate fairly and efficiently. Please be patient — I'm grieving too."

Most reasonable people will understand.

## What to do next

1. Give yourself permission to not be okay
2. Set realistic timelines — don't rush because of pressure
3. Accept help where offered
4. Keep records so you don't have to remember everything
5. Seek professional support if you're struggling
6. Remember: this is temporary. It will end.
