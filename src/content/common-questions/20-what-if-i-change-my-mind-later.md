Your will isn't permanent. You can change it at any time while you have mental capacity.

**Two ways to update:**

**Codicil:** A formal amendment to your existing will. Good for small changes.

**New will:** Replaces the old one entirely. Better for significant changes — and often simpler.

**When to update:**
- Marriage or divorce
- Birth of children or grandchildren
- Death of a beneficiary or executor
- Major change in assets
- Relationship breakdown or new relationship
- You simply change your mind

**What to know:**
- A new will should state it revokes all previous wills
- Destroy old copies to avoid confusion
- Tell your executor where to find the current version

**Don't delay:** If something major changes, update your will soon. An outdated will can cause as many problems as no will at all.
