You can't guarantee your will won't be challenged. But you can make a challenge much harder to win.

**Get the basics right:**
- Use a solicitor or trusted service
- Ensure proper witnessing
- Sign every page, date it clearly

**Demonstrate capacity:**
- If you're elderly or unwell, get a doctor's assessment
- Have a solicitor note that you understood what you were signing
- Avoid making major changes when seriously ill

**Avoid undue influence claims:**
- Don't have a beneficiary present when you sign
- Make decisions independently
- Keep notes about why you made certain choices

**Reduce surprises:**
- Talk to family about your intentions if appropriate
- Explain unusual decisions (in a separate letter if needed)
- Don't spring major exclusions on people

**Be specific:**
- Vague wills get challenged
- Clear, detailed instructions leave less room for interpretation

**Update when things change:**
- Marriage, divorce, births, deaths — review your will
- An outdated will invites disputes
