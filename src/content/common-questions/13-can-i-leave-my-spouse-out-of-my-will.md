You can write a will that leaves nothing to your spouse or partner. But that doesn't mean they'll receive nothing.

**Family provision claims:** In Australia, spouses and domestic partners can apply to the court for provision from your estate — even if you deliberately excluded them. Courts take these claims seriously, especially for long-term relationships.

**What the court considers:**
- Length of the relationship
- Financial contributions made
- Their current financial needs
- Whether they were dependent on you

**When exclusion might stand:**
- Very short relationships
- Where they have independent wealth
- Where there's been separation (but not divorce)

**Important:** If you're separated but not divorced, your spouse may still have automatic rights. Divorce generally revokes gifts to a former spouse, but separation alone does not.

**Best approach:** Get legal advice if you want to exclude or limit a spouse's share. A poorly worded will can create expensive court battles.
