Choosing an executor is less about finding the perfect person and more about choosing someone reliable.

An executor is the person responsible for carrying out your wishes after you die. They don’t need legal training, but they do need to be organised, trustworthy, and willing to deal with paperwork and decisions at a difficult time.

Many people choose a family member or close friend. Others prefer a professional executor, especially if their affairs are complex or relationships are strained.

What matters most is that the person you choose is capable and understands the responsibility involved.
