In most cases, you can change or cancel a power of attorney while you still have legal capacity.

This might involve appointing a different person, updating the scope of their authority, or revoking the arrangement entirely. Any changes usually need to be made formally and follow the same legal requirements as the original document.

Once a power of attorney is changed or revoked, it's important to notify the person previously appointed and any organisations that relied on the old arrangement.

If you lose capacity, your ability to make changes may be limited or no longer possible. Reviewing these documents periodically helps ensure they still reflect your wishes.
