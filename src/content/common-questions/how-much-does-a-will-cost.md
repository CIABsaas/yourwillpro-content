The cost of a will can vary widely.

Simple wills are often inexpensive, while more complex situations can increase the time and cost involved. Factors include family structure, asset types, and any special instructions you want included.

Cost is only one consideration. A clear and appropriate will can reduce confusion, delays, and disputes later.

Understanding what affects cost helps you make informed choices.
