quickAnswer: "FIFO work often means higher income, higher risk, and long periods away from family. If something happens at a remote site, your family needs clear instructions and access to everything — a will ensures they have it."

## FIFO life is different

Fly-in, fly-out workers face unique circumstances:

- **Remote locations** — Far from hospitals and emergency services
- **Higher-risk work** — Mining, construction, oil and gas
- **Time away** — Weeks away from family at a time
- **Higher income** — Often more assets to protect
- **Life insurance** — Usually have significant coverage through work

These factors make estate planning more important, not less.

## Higher risk is real

While mining and resource companies prioritise safety, the reality is that FIFO workers face higher occupational risks than average:

- Heavy machinery and equipment
- Remote site accidents
- Fatigue from roster patterns
- Hazardous materials exposure
- Limited emergency medical response

<div class="tip-box">
<p><strong>💡 Not just accidents:</strong> Remote sites can also mean delayed treatment for medical emergencies like heart attacks or strokes. Any delay can be the difference between life and death.</p>
</div>

## Your family needs access

If something happens while you're on site, your family needs immediate access to:

- Bank accounts and bills
- Mortgage payments
- Insurance policies
- Super information
- Your employer's contact details and benefits
- Important documents

A will is part of this — but so is making sure your family knows where everything is before there's a crisis.

## FIFO income and assets

Higher FIFO income often means:

- Significant superannuation balances
- Investment properties
- Share portfolios
- Savings and term deposits
- Valuable vehicles and equipment
- Larger life insurance coverage

All of this needs clear direction in your will.

## Super and life insurance through work

Most FIFO workers have substantial life insurance through their employer or super fund. But:

- Is the coverage enough for your family's needs?
- Who is nominated to receive it?
- Is the nomination binding and current?
- Does your family know the policy exists?

<div class="australia-note">
<p><strong>🇦🇺 In Australia:</strong> Employer-provided life insurance often pays through your super fund. Make sure your super binding nomination is up to date and coordinates with your will.</p>
</div>

## Mortgages and debt

FIFO income often supports significant mortgages. If you die:

- Can your partner keep up repayments?
- Is there life insurance to cover the mortgage?
- What happens if the house needs to be sold?
- Are there other debts to consider?

Your will should work with your insurance to ensure your family isn't forced to sell the home.

## Children and time away

If you have children, your roster already means missing time with them. Make sure:

- Guardians are nominated if both parents die
- Your will provides for their education and care
- There's a letter of wishes about how you want them raised
- Your family knows your intentions

## Partners left managing everything

FIFO partners often manage households solo during swings. They're capable — but do they have legal authority?

- **Power of Attorney** — Can they make financial decisions while you're away and unreachable?
- **Access to accounts** — Are they authorised on your bank accounts?
- **Will executor** — Are they named, or someone else?

Consider giving your partner enduring Power of Attorney for practical reasons, not just emergencies.

## What happens at work

Check with your employer about:

- Death-in-service benefits
- Workers' compensation procedures
- How your family would be notified
- What support they provide
- Return of personal belongings

Make sure your emergency contacts at work are current.

## What to do now

1. Make a will that covers all your assets
2. Check super binding nominations
3. Review life insurance — is coverage adequate?
4. Give your partner Power of Attorney
5. Create a "where to find everything" document
6. Have conversations with your family about your wishes
7. [Use our Preparation Checklist](/planning-tools/checklists/preparation) to organise everything
8. Update emergency contacts at work

<div class="warning-box">
<p><strong>⚠️ Reality check:</strong> FIFO rosters make it easy to put off paperwork until "next swing." But if something happens on site, your family shouldn't have to figure things out alone.</p>
