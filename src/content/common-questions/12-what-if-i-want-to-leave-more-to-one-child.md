It's your estate, and you can divide it however you choose. Many parents leave unequal shares for valid reasons — one child may have greater needs, another may have already received help during your lifetime, or your relationships may simply be different.

**The law allows this.** Australia doesn't require you to treat children equally.

**But there are risks:**
- Unequal distributions are more likely to be contested
- Family relationships can suffer if the decision feels unexplained
- A child who feels wronged may challenge the will

**How to reduce conflict:**
- Consider explaining your reasons (in a separate letter, not the will itself)
- Ensure your will is professionally prepared and clearly worded
- Talk to your family if you're comfortable doing so
- Document that you were of sound mind and not under pressure

**The question to ask yourself:** Will this decision make sense to the people left behind?
