quickAnswer: "A chronic illness diagnosis is a prompt to get your affairs in order — not because you're dying, but because you're taking control. A will is part of that, alongside Powers of Attorney and advance care planning."

## Taking control, not giving up

Being diagnosed with a chronic illness doesn't mean the end is near. Many people live for years or decades with conditions like diabetes, heart disease, MS, or cancer. But it does mean thinking about the future — and that includes your estate.

Making a will isn't about admitting defeat. It's about ensuring that whatever happens, the people you love are protected.

## Capacity matters — act while you can

One of the most important reasons to make a will now: legal capacity.

To make a valid will, you need to:
- Understand what you're doing
- Know what assets you have
- Understand who might expect to benefit
- Not be unduly influenced by others

Some illnesses can affect cognitive function over time. Making your will while you clearly have capacity protects against later challenges.

<div class="warning-box">
<p><strong>⚠️ Important:</strong> If there's any concern about your capacity, consider having a doctor assess and document it when you make your will. This can prevent challenges later.</p>
</div>

## Powers of Attorney are equally important

A will only takes effect when you die. But chronic illness might mean periods where you can't manage your own affairs while still alive.

You need:

**Enduring Power of Attorney (Financial):**
- Someone to pay your bills, manage investments, deal with Centrelink
- Access your bank accounts if you can't
- Make financial decisions on your behalf

**Medical Power of Attorney / Advance Care Directive:**
- Someone to make health decisions if you can't
- Your wishes about treatment documented
- Instructions about life support, resuscitation, comfort care

## Treatment costs and your estate

Chronic illness often comes with costs:
- Medications
- Medical appointments
- Hospital stays
- Home modifications
- Care assistance

Consider:
- Have you budgeted for ongoing care costs?
- Will there be anything left for beneficiaries?
- Does your estate plan account for potential care needs?
- Should you consider funeral prepayment to reduce burden?

## Protecting your dependants

If you have people depending on you:

- **Children** — Appoint guardians and set up testamentary trusts
- **Spouse/partner** — Ensure they're provided for, especially if they've been caring for you
- **Elderly parents** — Consider who continues to support them

Your illness might mean less earning time. Life insurance, income protection, and careful planning become more important.

## Having conversations now

Many people avoid talking about illness and death. But having conversations while you're well enough makes things easier:

- Tell your family what you want
- Discuss end-of-life care preferences
- Explain where important documents are
- Introduce them to your financial situation
- Ensure your wishes are understood

These conversations are a gift to your family, sparing them from guessing later.

## Choosing the right executor

With a chronic illness, your executor might need to act sooner than expected. Choose someone who:

- Is readily available
- Understands your situation
- Can work with medical and care providers
- Is emotionally prepared for the role
- Has the practical skills to manage your estate

Consider having a backup executor given the uncertainty.

## Review regularly

Unlike a healthy person who might review their will every few years, you may want to review more often:

- When your condition changes
- After major treatments
- If care arrangements change
- When family circumstances shift
- Annually at minimum

## What to do now

1. Make or update your will while you clearly have capacity
2. Create Enduring Powers of Attorney (financial and medical)
3. Complete an Advance Care Directive
4. Have conversations with your family about your wishes
5. Organise your important documents where they can be found
6. Review your insurance coverage
