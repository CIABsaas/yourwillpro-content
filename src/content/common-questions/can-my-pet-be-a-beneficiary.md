## The short answer

No. In Australia, pets are legally classified as property, not people. They can't own assets or inherit.

But that doesn't mean you can't plan for them.

## What you can do

While you can't leave money directly to Fluffy, you can:

1. **Leave your pet to someone** — Specify who should care for them
2. **Leave money to that person** — For the pet's care
3. **Set conditions** — On how the money should be used
4. **Create a pet trust** — For larger amounts or complex situations

## Option 1: Name a carer

The simplest approach:

> "I give my dog Max to my sister Jane Smith, together with $5,000 to be used for his care."

**Important considerations:**
- Ask Jane first — don't surprise someone with a pet
- Have a backup in case Jane can't take Max
- Consider whether Jane can realistically care for your pet

## Option 2: Conditional gift

Add conditions to ensure the money is used properly:

> "I leave $10,000 to Jane Smith on condition that she cares for my cat Luna for Luna's lifetime. If Jane is unwilling or unable, this gift passes to [backup person] on the same terms."

<p><strong>💡 Reality check:</strong> Conditions are hard to enforce after you're gone. Choose someone you trust, rather than relying on legal conditions alone.</p>
</div>

## Option 3: Pet trust

For larger estates or multiple animals, you can create a trust:

- Appoint a trustee to manage funds
- Name a carer responsible for the animal(s)
- Specify how funds should be used
- Set out standards of care expected

This is more complex and costly but provides more control.

## How much to leave

Consider:
- **Food and basics** — Annual cost varies by pet type
- **Veterinary care** — Routine and emergency
- **Pet insurance** — Ongoing premiums
- **Expected lifespan** — A parrot might outlive multiple carers

**Rough guide:**

| Pet | Annual cost (estimate) | 10-year provision |
|-----|----------------------|-------------------|
| Dog | $2,000–$5,000 | $20,000–$50,000 |
| Cat | $1,500–$3,000 | $15,000–$30,000 |
| Small pet | $500–$1,500 | $5,000–$15,000 |
| Horse | $5,000–$15,000 | $50,000–$150,000 |
| Parrot | $1,000–$3,000 | $10,000–$30,000+ |

Don't forget: some pets live a very long time.

## Include care instructions

Beyond your will, prepare a separate document with:

- Vet details and medical history
- Dietary requirements and preferences
- Daily routine
- Behavioural quirks
- Medication schedules
- Insurance policy details
- Microchip information

Leave this with your executor and the nominated carer.

<div class="australia-note">
<p><strong>🇦🇺 In Australia:</strong> Some animal welfare organisations will take pets if no family or friends can. RSPCA, Animal Welfare League, and breed-specific rescues may be options — contact them before including them in your will.</p>
</div>

## What about leaving pets to a charity?

Some organisations accept bequests that include pets:

- They may rehome your pet
- They may provide ongoing care
- Contact them first to understand their policies

This can be a backup if your primary carer can't continue.

## Common mistakes

❌ **Not asking the carer first** — They may not want or be able to take your pet

❌ **No backup plan** — The primary carer might predecease you or change circumstances

❌ **Leaving too little money** — Pets are expensive over their lifetime

❌ **Leaving too much with no conditions** — Money could be used for other purposes

❌ **Forgetting care instructions** — The new carer needs to know your pet's needs

## What happens if you don't plan

If your will doesn't mention your pets:

- They become part of your general estate (property)
- The executor decides what to do with them
- They may go to whoever is willing to take them
- Worst case: surrendered to a shelter

## What to do next

1. Choose a willing carer — and ask them
2. Identify a backup carer
3. Calculate reasonable care costs for your pet's expected lifespan
4. Include a specific gift in your will
5. Prepare detailed care instructions
6. Tell your executor where to find everything
