quickAnswer: "Without a will, your estate goes to your closest relatives in a fixed order — parents, then siblings, then nieces and nephews. If that's not what you want, or you want to include friends, partners, or charities, you need a will."

## Intestacy might not match your wishes

If you die without a will, Australian intestacy rules kick in. For single people without children, this typically means:

1. **Parents** — If alive, they inherit everything equally
2. **Siblings** — If parents have died, siblings share the estate
3. **Nieces and nephews** — If siblings have died, their children inherit their share
4. **Extended family** — If none of the above exist, it goes to grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins
5. **Government** — If no relatives can be found, the state takes everything

Is that what you want? Maybe. But maybe not.

## Who actually matters to you?

Think about the people who'd actually miss you:

- **Close friends** — Who've been there through everything
- **A partner** — Even if you're not married or living together
- **Nieces and nephews** — Who you're close to, not just related to
- **Charitable causes** — That reflect your values
- **Specific family members** — Not equally to all siblings, but to the one who needs it

Without a will, none of these nuances are possible. The law doesn't know who you actually care about.

<div class="tip-box">
<p><strong>💡 Think about it:</strong> If your brother is wealthy and your sister is struggling, intestacy gives them equal shares. Only a will lets you choose differently.</p>
</div>

## You probably have more than you think

Single people often underestimate their estates:

- **Superannuation** — Your largest asset, possibly
- **Property** — Even a small apartment or investment
- **Savings and investments** — Bank accounts, shares, managed funds
- **Vehicles** — Cars, motorbikes, boats
- **Valuables** — Art, jewellery, collectibles, electronics
- **Digital assets** — Crypto, online accounts, digital businesses

Without a will, all of this is distributed by formula, not choice.

## Super doesn't go through your will automatically

Here's something important: your super has its own beneficiary nomination, separate from your will.

<div class="australia-note">
<p><strong>🇦🇺 In Australia:</strong> If you're single with no dependants, you may have limited options for who can receive your super as a tax-free benefit. Non-dependants (like friends or siblings) may receive a lump sum but face significant tax. Nominating your estate gives you more control.</p>
</div>

Check your super fund's rules and make sure your nomination reflects your wishes.

## You can include friends

Unlike intestacy, a will lets you leave gifts to anyone — including friends.

- The friend who'd look after your cat
- The mate who helped you through a tough time
- The person you want to have your guitar, car, or book collection

These people get nothing under intestacy. A will changes that.

## Charities can benefit too

Many single people without children choose to leave some or all of their estate to causes they care about:

- Medical research
- Animal welfare
- Environmental causes
- Educational institutions
- Local community organisations

This is only possible with a will.

## Who handles everything?

Even if you're happy with where your estate goes, someone needs to manage the process. A will lets you choose your executor — someone you trust to:

- Locate your assets
- Pay your debts and taxes
- Deal with your landlord or property
- Distribute your belongings
- Close your accounts

Without a will, the court appoints an administrator, usually your next of kin. They may not know your wishes, your accounts, or your digital passwords.

## What about medical decisions?

While you're alive but unable to make decisions, who speaks for you? A will doesn't cover this — you need:

- **Enduring Power of Attorney** — For financial decisions
- **Medical Power of Attorney / Advance Care Directive** — For health decisions

These are especially important when you don't have a spouse to automatically step in.

## What to do now

1. List who you'd actually want to inherit — friends, family, charities
2. Check your super binding nomination
3. Think about who you'd trust as executor
4. Consider Powers of Attorney for your lifetime
5. [Use our Preparation Checklist](/planning-tools/checklists/preparation) to organise everything
6. Make a will that reflects your actual life, not just your family tree
