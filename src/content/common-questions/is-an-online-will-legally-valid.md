## The short answer

Yes. There's nothing in Australian law that requires a will to be handwritten, typed by a lawyer, or produced in any particular way. What matters is that the will meets the legal requirements for validity.

## What makes any will valid

In Australia, a valid will must:

1. **Be in writing** — Typed or handwritten, doesn't matter
2. **Be signed by you** — At the end of the document
3. **Be witnessed by two adults** — Who are present at the same time, watch you sign, and then sign themselves
4. **Show testamentary intention** — It must be clear you intend this to be your will

<p><strong>🇦🇺 In Australia:</strong> Witnessing requirements vary slightly by state. In most states, witnesses cannot be beneficiaries or married to beneficiaries. Check your state's specific rules.</p>

## What online will services provide

A good online will service:

- Asks you the right questions to capture your wishes
- Generates a properly formatted legal document
- Provides clear instructions for signing and witnessing
- Uses templates reviewed by lawyers
- Includes guidance on what to do next

The technology is just a tool for creating the document. The legal validity comes from following the proper signing process.

## When online wills work well

Online wills are well-suited for:

- Straightforward situations (spouse, children, clear beneficiaries)
- People who understand their assets and wishes
- Those comfortable using technology
- Situations without complex family dynamics

## When you might need more help

Consider a lawyer if you have:

- Blended families with competing interests
- Business ownership or complex structures
- Assets in multiple countries
- Family members who might contest the will
- Significant wealth requiring tax planning
- Special needs beneficiaries

<div class="tip-box">
<p><strong>💡 The real question:</strong> It's not "is an online will valid?" but "is an online will right for my situation?" Validity is about following the rules. Suitability is about matching the tool to your needs.</p>

## Common mistakes that invalidate wills

These mistakes can invalidate any will, online or otherwise:

- ❌ Not having two witnesses present when you sign
- ❌ Having a witness who is also a beneficiary
- ❌ Not signing at the end of the document
- ❌ Making changes by crossing out or writing over
- ❌ Not having mental capacity when signing

## What to do next

1. Assess whether your situation suits an online will
2. Choose a reputable service with lawyer-reviewed templates
3. Follow the signing instructions exactly
4. Store the original safely
5. Tell your executor where to find it
