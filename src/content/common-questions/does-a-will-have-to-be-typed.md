A will does not usually have to be typed to be valid.

What matters most is that the will meets legal requirements, such as being properly signed and witnessed. Handwritten wills can be valid in some situations, but they may create uncertainty or disputes if they are unclear.

Typed wills are generally easier to read, store, and update, which reduces the risk of confusion later.

Clarity is often more important than format.
