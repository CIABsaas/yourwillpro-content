## It's not about better — it's about fit

Asking "which is better" is like asking whether a bicycle or a car is better. It depends where you're going.

Both online wills and lawyer-prepared wills are legally valid. The question is which suits your situation.

## Online wills: best for

| Situation | Why it works |
|-----------|--------------|
| Straightforward wishes | Everything to spouse, then children |
| Clear assets | Home, super, savings — nothing complex |
| No family conflict | Everyone gets along, no expected challenges |
| Budget-conscious | Cost matters and you have simple needs |
| Tech-comfortable | You can follow online instructions |

**Typical cost:** $50–$250

**Time:** 20–60 minutes

## Lawyer-prepared wills: best for

| Situation | Why you need it |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Blended families | Stepchildren, ex-spouses, competing interests |
| Business ownership | Succession planning, buy-sell agreements |
| Complex assets | Trusts, companies, overseas property |
| Testamentary trusts | Tax-effective structures for beneficiaries |
| Potential disputes | Family members who might challenge |
| Special needs | Beneficiaries on disability support |

**Typical cost:** $300–$1,500+ depending on complexity

**Time:** 1–4 weeks including consultations

<div class="australia-note">
<p><strong>🇦🇺 In Australia:</strong> Public trustees in each state offer will-writing services, often free or low-cost if they're appointed as executor. This can be a middle-ground option.</p>

## What you get with a lawyer

Beyond the document itself:

- **Advice** — They can identify issues you hadn't considered
- **Customisation** — Clauses tailored to your specific situation
- **Explanation** — They ensure you understand what you're signing
- **Coordination** — Links to super, POA, and other planning
- **Defence** — A lawyer-prepared will may be harder to challenge

## What you get with online services

- **Convenience** — Complete at home, any time
- **Speed** — Finished in one sitting
- **Cost savings** — Fraction of lawyer fees
- **Privacy** — No need to discuss personal matters face-to-face
- **Templates** — Proven formats reviewed by legal professionals

## The hidden middle ground

Some options between DIY and full legal service:

- **Online services with lawyer review** — Create online, lawyer checks it
- **Fixed-fee legal services** — Lawyers offering simple wills at set prices
- **Legal aid** — If you qualify, free or subsidised help
- **Community legal centres** — Free services for eligible people

## Questions to help you decide

Ask yourself:

1. Is my family situation straightforward? (Yes = online probably fine)
2. Do I have assets in trusts or companies? (Yes = probably need lawyer)
3. Is anyone likely to challenge my will? (Yes = probably need lawyer)
4. Do I have children under 18? (Maybe need testamentary trust = lawyer)
5. Can I afford a lawyer? (No = online is valid alternative)

<div class="tip-box">
<p><strong>💡 The worst choice:</strong> Doing nothing because you can't decide. A simple online will is infinitely better than no will at all.</p>
</div>

## What to do next

4. If unsure: Start with a lawyer consultation — many offer free initial chats
