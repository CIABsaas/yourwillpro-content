## Super isn't automatically part of your estate

Here's something that surprises most people: your superannuation doesn't automatically form part of your estate.

When you die, your super fund's trustee decides who receives your death benefit, unless you've made a valid nomination. The trustee will consider:

- Any nomination you've made
- Your dependants (as defined by super law)
- Your legal personal representative (your estate)

Without clear instructions from you, the trustee makes the call.

<div class="australia-note">
<p><strong>🇦🇺 In Australia:</strong> Different super funds have different rules about nominations. Some only allow non-binding nominations. Some binding nominations expire after 3 years. Check your specific fund's rules.</p>
</div>

## Types of nominations

There are several ways to direct your super:

**Non-binding nomination:**
- You suggest who should receive your super
- The trustee considers your wishes but isn't bound by them
- Trustee makes the final decision
- Most common type offered by funds

**Binding death benefit nomination:**
- The trustee must pay according to your nomination
- Usually expires after 3 years (needs renewal)
- Must be correctly witnessed
- Only valid beneficiaries can be named

**Non-lapsing binding nomination:**
- Same as binding, but doesn't expire
- Not all funds offer this
- Still needs valid beneficiaries

**Reversionary pension nomination:**
- For those receiving a pension from their super
- Nominates who continues receiving the pension
- Important for retirees

## Who can receive your super?

Super law limits who can be a direct beneficiary:

**Dependants (can receive tax-free):**
- Spouse (including de facto)
- Children under 18
- Anyone in an interdependency relationship
- Anyone financially dependent on you

**Non-dependants:**
- Adult children (unless financially dependent)
- Parents, siblings, friends
- Can still receive super, but may pay tax on it
- Often better to nominate your estate, then distribute through your will

## Super and your will: coordination is key

Your super and will need to work together:

**Option 1: Nominate individuals directly**
- They receive super outside the estate
- Can be faster and avoid probate delays
- But less flexible if circumstances change

**Option 2: Nominate your estate (legal personal representative)**
- Super becomes part of your estate
- Your will controls distribution
- More flexibility, but tax treatment may differ
- Subject to probate process

<div class="tip-box">
<p><strong>💡 Pro tip:</strong> If you nominate your estate, make sure your will actually addresses your super. Many wills don't explicitly deal with super, creating confusion.</p>
</div>

## Common super mistakes

- ❌ Never making a nomination — trustee decides
- ❌ Letting binding nominations lapse — defaults to trustee discretion
- ❌ Nominating someone who isn't an eligible dependant — nomination may be invalid
- ❌ Nominating ex-spouse after divorce — could still be valid if not updated
- ❌ Assuming will overrides super — it doesn't
- ❌ Not checking fund's specific rules — they vary significantly

## Tax implications

Who receives your super affects how much tax they pay:

- **Dependants** — Generally tax-free
- **Non-dependants** — May pay up to 32% on the taxable component
- **Children 18-25** — Complex rules depending on dependency status
- **Estate** — Tax depends on who ultimately receives it

A financial adviser can help optimise the tax outcome.

## Multiple super funds

If you have multiple super accounts (many Australians do):
- Each fund needs its own nomination
- One will doesn't cover all funds automatically
- Consider consolidating for simplicity

## What to do now

1. **Find all your super accounts** — Check ATO's myGov to see what you have
2. **Check each fund's nomination options** — Binding, non-binding, non-lapsing?
3. **Review current nominations** — Are they current? Correct? Valid?
4. **Decide your approach** — Direct nomination or via estate?
5. **Update your will** — Make sure it coordinates with your super strategy
6. **Set a reminder** — If binding nominations lapse, you need to renew them

<div class="warning-box">
<p><strong>⚠️ Important:</strong> Your super could be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Don't leave its distribution to chance or a trustee who doesn't know your wishes.</p>
