You can leave your estate to whoever you want. But some people have a legal right to challenge your will if they believe they should have been included.

**Who can make a claim (varies by state):**
- Spouse or domestic partner
- Children (including adult children)
- Former spouse (in some cases)
- Dependants
- Sometimes stepchildren or grandchildren

**Who generally cannot claim:**
- Siblings
- Friends
- Extended family (unless dependent on you)

**If you want to exclude someone:**
- State it clearly (but you don't have to explain why in the will)
- Ensure your will is properly witnessed
- Consider a statutory declaration about your reasons
- Get legal advice if the person is a spouse or child

**What happens if they challenge:**
- The court weighs their need against your wishes
- Strong evidence that you were of sound mind and not pressured helps
- The estate pays legal costs, reducing what's left for everyone

**Bottom line:** You can exclude people, but close family members have legal avenues to contest. Plan accordingly.
