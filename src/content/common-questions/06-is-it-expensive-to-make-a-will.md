Cost is often the quiet reason a will gets delayed.

The price of a will usually reflects complexity, not importance.
Simple situations tend to cost less because fewer decisions and explanations are required.

What’s often overlooked is the difference between:
- the cost of making a will
- the cost of not having one

Delays, confusion, and additional administration can increase costs for others later.

A will doesn't need to be final or perfect.
For many people, having something clear in place is the most valuable step.
