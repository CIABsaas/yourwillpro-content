## Why people leave charitable gifts

A gift in your will — sometimes called a bequest — lets you:

- Support causes that mattered throughout your life
- Leave a legacy beyond your family
- Make a larger gift than you could afford while living
- Potentially reduce tax for your estate

Many of Australia's hospitals, universities, medical research, and community organisations rely on gifts in wills.

## Types of charitable gifts

**Specific amount**
> "I leave $10,000 to the Cancer Council NSW."

Simple and clear. The charity receives exactly this amount.

**Percentage of estate**
> "I leave 5% of my residuary estate to the Royal Flying Doctor Service."

The gift adjusts with your estate's value. Useful if you're unsure what you'll have when you die.

**Residuary gift**
> "I leave the remainder of my estate equally between my children and the RSPCA."

The charity shares whatever's left after specific gifts and expenses.

**Specific asset**
> "I leave my property at 10 Smith Street to Médecins Sans Frontières."

Give a particular asset directly to the organisation.

<p><strong>💡 Best practice:</strong> Percentage or residuary gifts are often better than fixed amounts. They adjust automatically if your estate grows or shrinks.</p>

## How to identify the charity correctly

Charities can merge, change names, or close. To avoid problems:

1. **Use the full legal name** — Not the trading name or abbreviation
2. **Include the ABN** — Australian Business Number
3. **Specify the state** — If relevant (e.g., "Cancer Council Victoria" not just "Cancer Council")
4. **Add a fallback** — What happens if the charity no longer exists

**Example:**
> "I leave 10% of my residuary estate to the Salvation Army (Australia) Eastern Territory (ABN 99 597 121 429). If this organisation no longer exists at my death, this gift shall go to [alternative charity]."

## Checking the charity is genuine

Before including a charity:

- Verify it's a registered charity: [acnc.gov.au](https://www.acnc.gov.au)
- Check deductible gift recipient (DGR) status with the ATO
- Contact them directly — many have bequest teams who can help

<div class="australia-note">
<p><strong>🇦🇺 In Australia:</strong> To qualify for tax deductions (for your estate), the charity usually needs DGR status. Check with the organisation or the ATO.</p>
</div>

## Telling the charity (or not)

You're not required to tell a charity you've included them. But if you do:

**Benefits of telling them:**
- They can thank you and keep you connected
- They can confirm correct legal details
- Reduces risk of errors in the will
- Some offer "recognition" programs

**Reasons to keep it private:**
- Your plans might change
- You prefer privacy
- You don't want to feel pressured

Either approach is fine.

## Family first (usually)

Most people provide for family first, then leave a percentage or residue to charity. Consider:

- Will your family be adequately provided for?
- Could a charitable gift lead to family provision claims?
- Have you discussed your intentions with family?

A reasonable charitable gift is unlikely to be challenged. A gift that leaves family with nothing might be.

## Conditional gifts

You can attach conditions:

> "I leave $50,000 to the University of Melbourne for medical research scholarships."

Be careful with conditions:
- Too restrictive may make the gift unusable
- Check with the charity if conditions are practical
- Include a fallback if conditions can't be met

## Multiple charities

You can give to several:

> "I leave 5% of my residuary estate to each of the following: Oxfam Australia, Doctors Without Borders, and the Fred Hollows Foundation."

## What happens to the gift

After your death:
- Your executor contacts the charity
- They provide probate and documentation
- The charity acknowledges receipt
- The gift is used according to your wishes (or their general purposes)

## What to do next

1. Decide which causes matter most to you
2. Research and verify the charities
3. Decide on gift type (amount, percentage, residuary)
4. Get correct legal names and ABNs
5. Include a fallback clause
6. Consider telling the charity (optional)
7. Discuss with family if appropriate
