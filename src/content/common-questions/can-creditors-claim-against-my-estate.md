When someone dies, their debts do not simply disappear.

In most cases, outstanding debts are paid from the estate before anything is distributed to beneficiaries. This includes things like personal loans, credit cards, tax obligations, and other liabilities in the deceased person's name.

The executor is responsible for identifying creditors, confirming what is owed, and ensuring valid debts are paid in the correct order. Beneficiaries are usually not personally responsible for these debts unless they were jointly liable or had provided a guarantee.

If the estate does not have enough assets to cover all debts, it may be considered insolvent. In that situation, strict rules apply about which debts are paid first, and beneficiaries may receive less — or nothing at all.

Understanding this early helps avoid confusion and unrealistic expectations during estate administration.
