Superannuation is generally not controlled by your will.

In most cases, super is paid according to a nomination you make with your super fund, rather than instructions in your will. This means your will may not determine who receives your super benefits.

Some people use binding death benefit nominations to provide clearer direction. Others rely on the fund's trustee to decide, based on the fund's rules and relevant laws.

Understanding how your super is handled helps avoid mismatches between your will and your overall estate plan.
