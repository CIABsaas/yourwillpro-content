## Marriage revokes your will

This catches most people off guard: in most Australian states and territories, the moment you say "I do," your existing will becomes invalid.

<div class="australia-note">
<p><strong>🇦🇺 State rules:</strong> Marriage revokes wills in NSW, QLD, VIC, SA, WA, and the ACT. In Tasmania and the NT, marriage doesn't automatically revoke a will, but it may still affect how assets are distributed.</p>
</div>

This means that even if you had a comprehensive will made last year, getting married can wipe it out entirely.

## What happens without a new will

If you die without a valid will after marriage, intestacy rules apply. In most cases:

- Your spouse receives most or all of your estate
- But the formula varies by state
- If you have children from a previous relationship, things get complicated
- Your spouse may have to share with your parents or siblings

This might sound okay, but what if:
- You wanted specific items to go to specific people?
- You had promises to family members?
- Your spouse is already financially secure and you wanted to help others?

## The "in contemplation of marriage" exception

There's one way to keep your will valid through marriage: include a specific clause stating the will is made "in contemplation of marriage" to your named partner.

But this requires:
- Making or updating your will before the wedding
- Naming your specific future spouse
- Proper legal wording

If your pre-wedding will didn't include this, it's been revoked.

## Time to think as a team

Marriage is the perfect time to:

1. **Discuss your combined assets** — What do you each bring to the marriage?
2. **Align your wishes** — Do you want everything to go to each other?
3. **Consider mirror wills** — Matching wills that leave everything to each other, then to agreed beneficiaries
4. **Name each other as executors** — Or choose someone you both trust
5. **Update super beneficiaries** — Add your spouse to binding nominations

## Don't forget these

Beyond the will itself, marriage should trigger updates to:

- **Superannuation beneficiaries** — Your spouse is now a tax-effective beneficiary
- **Life insurance** — Update or increase coverage
- **Power of Attorney** — Appoint your spouse (or discuss alternatives)
- **Emergency contacts** — Banks, employers, doctors

<div class="tip-box">
<p><strong>💡 Wedding tip:</strong> Add "make new wills" to your wedding to-do list, right alongside booking the venue and choosing the cake. It's one of the most practical things you can do for each other.</p>
</div>

## What about a prenup?

A binding financial agreement (sometimes called a prenup) and a will serve different purposes:

- **Financial agreements** — Protect assets if the marriage ends in divorce
- **Wills** — Distribute assets if the marriage ends in death

They work together but don't replace each other. If you have a financial agreement, your will should align with it.

## What to do now

1. Check if your state revokes wills upon marriage
2. [Use our Preparation Checklist](/planning-tools/checklists/preparation) to gather what you need
3. Make new wills together — within the first month of marriage ideally
4. Update super and insurance beneficiaries
5. Consider Powers of Attorney for each other
