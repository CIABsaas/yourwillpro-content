## The confusion

People often use "joint will" and "mirror wills" interchangeably. They're not the same thing — and choosing wrong can cause serious problems.

## Mirror wills (what most couples want)

Mirror wills are two separate wills that reflect each other's wishes.

**How they work:**
- Each person makes their own will
- Both wills have matching (or similar) provisions
- Typically: "Everything to my spouse, then to our children"
- Each will is independent

**Key feature:** Either person can change their will at any time, without the other's consent.

**Example:**
> Sarah's will: "Everything to Tom. If Tom dies first, to our children equally."
> Tom's will: "Everything to Sarah. If Sarah dies first, to our children equally."

Two documents. Same intentions. Complete flexibility.

## Joint wills (rarely recommended)

A joint will is a single document signed by two people.

**How they work:**
- One document covers both people
- Often includes a "mutual will" agreement — a promise not to change it after one person dies
- The survivor is bound by the agreement

**Key feature:** The surviving person may be legally prevented from changing the will, even decades later.

## Why joint wills cause problems

**Scenario:** Tom and Sarah make a joint will leaving everything to each other, then to their children. Tom dies.

Sarah is now bound by the joint will. She cannot:
- Provide for a new partner if she remarries
- Adjust for changed circumstances
- Help a child who falls on hard times
- Respond to family changes (births, deaths, divorces)

She's locked into decisions made years ago, when life was different.

## When might a joint will make sense?

Very rarely. Possible situations:

- Blended families where both partners want to guarantee their children inherit
- High conflict situations where one partner fears the other will change everything
- Specific legal advice recommends it for your circumstances

Even then, there are usually better alternatives.

## The better alternative for most couples

**Mirror wills with a conversation.**

- Make separate wills with matching provisions
- Discuss your intentions openly
- Understand either can change their will later
- Trust that you've chosen a partner who shares your values

If you're worried your spouse will disinherit your children after you die, consider:
- A testamentary trust that protects certain assets
- Life insurance payable directly to children
- A binding financial agreement
- Having a deeper conversation about your concerns

<p><strong>🇦🇺 In Australia:</strong> Mutual will agreements (even in mirror wills) can be enforced, but the law varies by state. If you want to bind the survivor, get specific legal advice.</p>
