## Equal isn't always fair

Most parents default to dividing their estate equally among children. It feels fair and avoids the appearance of favouritism.

But sometimes equal shares don't reflect reality:

- One child has significant disability or health needs
- One child has already received substantial financial help
- One child is a carer who sacrificed their career
- One child is wealthy while another struggles
- One child is estranged or has made harmful choices

In these situations, unequal shares might actually be fairer.

## Common reasons for unequal division

**Need-based differences**
- A child with a disability needs lifelong support
- A child with chronic illness faces ongoing costs
- A child going through a divorce needs protection

**Contribution differences**
- A child gave up their career to care for you
- A child worked in the family business for minimal pay
- A child stayed close and provided daily support

**Lifetime gifts already made**
- You helped one child buy a house
- You funded one child's education
- You gave one child business start-up capital

**Relationship differences**
- A child is estranged and has caused significant harm
- A child has shown no interest in the family
- (Be careful here — this is often contested)

<div class="tip-box">
<p><strong>💡 Document everything:</strong> If you've already given significant gifts to one child, document them. Write down dates, amounts, and whether they were intended as advancement of inheritance.</p>
</div>

## Should you tell your children?

**Arguments for telling them:**

- No surprises = less conflict
- They can ask questions while you're alive
- Reduces the "discovery shock" after your death
- Gives them time to accept your reasoning
- Prevents suspicion of undue influence

**Arguments against telling them:**

- Your decision might change
- It can create immediate conflict
- Some children may try to influence you
- Privacy — it's your choice to make
- Some things are better left unsaid

**Middle ground:**

Tell them you've made careful decisions without detailing amounts. Let them know you've considered everyone's circumstances.

## How to have the conversation

If you decide to explain:

**Choose the setting**
- Private, one-on-one conversations (not family gatherings)
- A calm, neutral time (not during conflict)
- Allow time for questions

**Lead with love**
- "I love you all equally. My will reflects different circumstances, not different amounts of love."
- "I've thought about what's fair for everyone's situation."

**Be honest but kind**
- Explain your reasoning clearly
- Acknowledge feelings
- Don't apologise excessively — you have the right to decide

**Stay firm**
- Listen to concerns, but don't be swayed by pressure
- "I understand this is hard to hear. This is my decision."

## What to include in your will

<div class="australia-note">
<p><strong>🇦🇺 In Australia:</strong> Family provision laws allow children and dependants to challenge a will if they weren't adequately provided for. Explain your reasoning in a letter of wishes to help defend against claims.</p>
</div>

**In the will itself:**
- Clear distribution instructions
- Consider a clause acknowledging lifetime gifts

**In a letter of wishes:**
- Your reasoning for the distribution
- Acknowledgment of any past gifts
- Statement that decisions reflect fairness, not favouritism
- Personal messages to each child

## Protecting against challenges

Unequal wills are more likely to be contested. To strengthen your will:

1. **Get proper legal advice** — A lawyer can help structure things properly
2. **Document your reasoning** — In a letter of wishes
3. **Consider capacity assessment** — If you're older or unwell
4. **Keep records of lifetime gifts** — Amounts, dates, purposes
5. **Be consistent** — Changing your will repeatedly can invite challenge
6. **Communicate (if appropriate)** — Reduce surprise and suspicion

## What if a child is upset?

**Listen first**
Let them express their feelings without becoming defensive.

**Reiterate your love**
"This decision doesn't reflect how much I love you."

**Explain once, then stop**
You don't need to justify repeatedly or endlessly debate.

**Acknowledge their feelings**
"I understand this is disappointing. I've made the decision I believe is fair."

**Hold your ground**
"I hear you. This is still my decision."

## When equal is better after all

Sometimes equal shares make sense even when circumstances differ:

- Perceived unfairness causes lasting family damage
- The differences aren't significant enough to matter
- You value family harmony above mathematical fairness
- Children will equalise informally among themselves

There's no universally right answer.

## What to do next

1. Reflect honestly on whether unequal shares are warranted
2. Document lifetime gifts and your reasoning
3. Seek legal advice about structuring your will
4. Decide whether to communicate your plans
5. Write a letter of wishes explaining your thinking
6. Prepare for difficult conversations if you choose to have them
7. Review your decision regularly — circumstances change
