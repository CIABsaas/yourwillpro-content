    <!-- MAIN CONTENT -->
    <article class="main-content">

      <div class="intro">
        <p>Research from Finder.com.au reveals that <strong>9.9 million Australian adults</strong> don't have a will. That's more than half the adult population leaving their families exposed to potential legal battles, unnecessary costs, and the government deciding who gets what.</p>
        <p>We've compiled the top 10 excuses — and the reality check for each one.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Reason 1 -->
      <div class="reason-card" id="reason-1">
        <div class="reason-header">
          <div class="reason-number">1</div>
          <div class="reason-stat">40% of people</div>
        </div>
        <h2 class="reason-title">"I'll get around to it later"</h2>
        <p>The classic. Procrastination is the number one reason people die without a will. We all think we have plenty of time. Life gets busy. It's not urgent today, so it can wait until tomorrow.</p>
        <blockquote class="reason-quote">
          "I've been meaning to do it for years. It's always on my list, but something more pressing always comes up."
        </blockquote>
        <div class="reality-check">
          <strong>Reality:</strong> Tomorrow isn't guaranteed for anyone. The average time to write a will online is under 30 minutes. That's less time than an episode of your favourite show. Every day you delay is another day your family is unprotected.
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Reason 2 -->
      <div class="reason-card" id="reason-2">
        <div class="reason-header">
          <div class="reason-number">2</div>
          <div class="reason-stat">30% of people</div>
        </div>
        <h2 class="reason-title">"I don't have enough assets"</h2>
        <p>Many people believe wills are only for the wealthy. If you don't own a mansion or have millions in the bank, why bother?</p>
        <blockquote class="reason-quote">
          "I'm not rich. I don't own property. What's the point of a will when I barely have anything?"
        </blockquote>
        <div class="reality-check">
          <strong>Reality:</strong> A will isn't just about property. It covers your superannuation (which could be hundreds of thousands), your car, your personal belongings, digital assets, and — crucially — who looks after your children. Even a small estate without a will can create big problems and costs for your family.
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Reason 3 -->
      <div class="reason-card" id="reason-3">
        <div class="reason-header">
          <div class="reason-number">3</div>
          <div class="reason-stat">28% of people</div>
        </div>
        <h2 class="reason-title">"I'm too young"</h2>
        <p>Estate planning feels like something for older people. When you're in your 20s or 30s, death seems impossibly far away.</p>
        <blockquote class="reason-quote">
          "I'm only 32. I'll think about a will when I'm retired."
        </blockquote>
        <div class="reality-check">
          <strong>Reality:</strong> Accidents and illness don't check your age. If you have a partner, children, assets, or even just strong opinions about who shouldn't inherit your belongings, you need a will. Many young Australians have significant super balances and digital assets worth protecting.
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Reason 4 -->
      <div class="reason-card" id="reason-4">
        <div class="reason-header">
          <div class="reason-number">4</div>
          <div class="reason-stat">16% of people</div>
        </div>
        <h2 class="reason-title">"I don't want to think about death"</h2>
        <p>Let's be honest — no one enjoys contemplating their own mortality. Writing a will forces you to face uncomfortable truths.</p>
        <blockquote class="reason-quote">
          "It's morbid. I don't want to jinx anything by planning for my death."
        </blockquote>
        <div class="reality-check">
          <strong>Reality:</strong> Having a will doesn't make death more likely — it makes the aftermath less painful for everyone you love. Think of it not as planning for death, but as protecting your family. It's an act of love, not pessimism.
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Reason 5 -->
      <div class="reason-card" id="reason-5">
        <div class="reason-header">
          <div class="reason-number">5</div>
        </div>
        <h2 class="reason-title">"It's too complicated"</h2>
        <p>Legal documents, executor duties, probate, intestacy laws... The language alone is enough to make your head spin.</p>
        <blockquote class="reason-quote">
          "I wouldn't even know where to start. Do I need a lawyer? What forms do I fill in?"
        </blockquote>
        <div class="reality-check">
          <strong>Reality:</strong> For most Australians, a will is straightforward. You decide who gets what, who'll manage your estate (executor), and who'll care for your kids (guardian). Modern online services guide you through each step in plain English — no legal jargon required.
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Reason 6 -->
      <div class="reason-card" id="reason-6">
        <div class="reason-header">
          <div class="reason-number">6</div>
        </div>
        <h2 class="reason-title">"It's too expensive"</h2>
        <p>Lawyers charge hundreds of dollars per hour. Surely a proper will must cost a fortune?</p>
        <blockquote class="reason-quote">
          "I've heard solicitors charge $500+ for a basic will. I can't afford that right now."
        </blockquote>
        <div class="reality-check">
          <strong>Reality:</strong> While complex estates may need a solicitor, most standard wills can be created online for under $200. Compare that to the cost of dying intestate: legal fees, court applications, family disputes, and delays that can drag on for years. A will is one of the cheapest forms of insurance you can buy.
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Reason 7 -->
      <div class="reason-card" id="reason-7">
        <div class="reason-header">
          <div class="reason-number">7</div>
        </div>
        <h2 class="reason-title">"My family will just sort it out"</h2>
        <p>You trust your family. They know what you'd want. They'll divide everything fairly without needing a piece of paper telling them what to do.</p>
        <blockquote class="reason-quote">
          "My kids get along great. They'll figure it out between themselves."
        </blockquote>
        <div class="reality-check">
          <strong>Reality:</strong> Grief does strange things to people. Without clear instructions, even close families can fall apart over who gets what. In Australia, 51% of contested estates involve family provision claims. A will doesn't just distribute assets — it prevents arguments by making your wishes crystal clear.
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Reason 8 -->
      <div class="reason-card" id="reason-8">
        <div class="reason-header">
          <div class="reason-number">8</div>
        </div>
        <h2 class="reason-title">"My situation is too complicated"</h2>
        <p>Blended families, estranged relatives, overseas assets, business interests... Some situations feel too messy to untangle.</p>
        <blockquote class="reason-quote">
          "I've been married twice, have kids from both marriages, and my brother and I haven't spoken in years. Where do I even begin?"
        </blockquote>
        <div class="reality-check">
          <strong>Reality:</strong> Complex situations are exactly why you need a will. Without one, intestacy laws will make those decisions for you — and they don't account for estrangements, second families, or your actual wishes. A complicated life needs a clear will, not no will at all.
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Reason 9 -->
      <div class="reason-card" id="reason-9">
        <div class="reason-header">
          <div class="reason-number">9</div>
        </div>
        <h2 class="reason-title">"I don't know who to choose as executor"</h2>
        <p>Choosing someone to manage your estate feels like a huge responsibility to place on someone. What if they say no? What if you pick the wrong person?</p>
        <blockquote class="reason-quote">
          "I don't want to burden my kids with that. And I'm not sure I trust anyone else enough."
        </blockquote>
        <div class="reality-check">
          <strong>Reality:</strong> Most people are honoured to be asked. You can name a trusted friend, family member, or even a professional trustee company. You can also name backup executors. The key is having someone — anyone — rather than leaving it to the courts to appoint an administrator.
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Reason 10 -->
      <div class="reason-card" id="reason-10">
        <div class="reason-header">
          <div class="reason-number">10</div>
        </div>
        <h2 class="reason-title">"I already have one somewhere..."</h2>
        <p>You vaguely remember signing something years ago. It's probably in a drawer somewhere. Or maybe at your parents' house?</p>
        <blockquote class="reason-quote">
          "I did a will when I got married. That was 15 years and two kids ago, but it should still be fine, right?"
        </blockquote>
        <div class="reality-check">
          <strong>Reality:</strong> An outdated will can be worse than no will. Major life events — marriage, divorce, children, property purchases — can all invalidate or complicate an old will. If your will is more than 5 years old or doesn't reflect your current situation, it's time for a review.
