        <h2>What is a Power of Attorney?</h2>
        <p>A Power of Attorney (POA) is a legal document that allows you to appoint another person – called your "attorney" – to make decisions on your behalf. Despite the name, your attorney does not need to be a lawyer. They can be any trusted adult: a spouse, family member, or close friend.</p>
        <p>Unlike a will, which only takes effect after death, a Power of Attorney operates while you are alive. It is designed to protect you if illness, accident, or age affects your ability to manage your own affairs.</p>
        <p>Creating a Power of Attorney when you are healthy and mentally capable is one of the most important steps in estate planning. Without one, your family may need to apply to a tribunal or court for guardianship – an expensive, time-consuming, and emotionally difficult process.</p>

        <h2>Why You Need a Power of Attorney</h2>

            </div>
            <h3>Medical Emergency</h3>
            <p>You suffer a stroke and cannot communicate. Without an Enduring Power of Attorney, your spouse cannot access your bank accounts to pay the mortgage, cannot sell investments to cover medical costs, and cannot make decisions about your care.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="scenario-card">

            <h3>Dementia</h3>
            <p>Early-stage dementia gradually affects your judgment. An Enduring POA created while you still have capacity allows a smooth transition of decision-making to your chosen attorney, rather than a crisis-driven tribunal application by your family.</p>

            <h3>Extended Travel</h3>
            <p>You plan to travel overseas for six months. A General (non-enduring) POA allows someone to handle your property sale, manage investments, or deal with government agencies while you are away.</p>

        <p>Selecting the right attorney is one of the most important decisions you will make. Consider:</p>
        
        <div class="criteria-list">
          <div class="criteria-item">
            <h4>Trustworthiness</h4>
            <p>Your attorney will have significant power over your finances or health. Choose someone whose integrity you do not question.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="criteria-item">
            <h4>Capability</h4>
            <p>Can they manage financial matters competently? Do they understand your values regarding medical treatment? Are they organised enough to handle paperwork and deadlines?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="criteria-item">
            <h4>Availability</h4>
            <p>Will they be accessible when needed? Someone living overseas or with demanding work commitments may struggle to act promptly.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="criteria-item">
            <h4>Willingness</h4>
            <p>Have you discussed this with them? Being an attorney carries legal responsibilities and can be burdensome. Never assume someone will accept without asking.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="criteria-item">
            <h4>Age</h4>
            <p>Consider their age relative to yours. An attorney close to your age may develop capacity issues around the same time you do.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>You can appoint multiple attorneys to act jointly (all must agree), severally (each can act independently), or jointly and severally (either arrangement depending on the situation). Consider appointing a substitute attorney in case your first choice cannot act.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>
        
        <div class="faq-list">
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Can I make a POA if I am already unwell?</summary>
            <p>You must have mental capacity to create a valid POA. If you already have dementia or another condition affecting decision-making, it may be too late. A doctor's assessment may be required to confirm capacity. This is why creating a POA while healthy is essential.</p>
          </details>
          
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Can I cancel or change my POA?</summary>
            <p>Yes, as long as you still have mental capacity. You can revoke a POA at any time by creating a revocation document and notifying your attorney and any institutions that hold copies.</p>
          </details>
          
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>What if my attorney misuses their power?</summary>
            <p>Attorneys have legal duties to act in your best interests, keep records, avoid conflicts of interest, and keep your property separate from theirs. Misuse of power is a criminal offence. If you suspect abuse, contact your state's civil and administrative tribunal.</p>
          </details>
          
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Does my POA work interstate or overseas?</summary>
            <p>Australian states have mutual recognition provisions, so a POA made in one state generally works in another. However, there are exceptions, and a POA made overseas may not be recognised in Australia. If you own property in multiple states, consider getting state-specific advice.</p>
