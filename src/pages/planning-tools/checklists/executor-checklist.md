# Choosing an Executor Checklist

**Your executor is the person responsible for carrying out your will.** It's one of the most important decisions you'll make. Use this checklist to think through your choice.

---

## Essential Qualities

*Does your chosen person have:*

☐ Willingness to take on the role (have you actually asked them?)

☐ Trustworthiness and integrity

☐ Ability to be impartial between beneficiaries

☐ Organisational skills to manage paperwork and deadlines

☐ Availability — time to devote to the task when needed

☐ Good health and likely to outlive you

☐ Australian residency (overseas executors can create complications)

---

## Practical Considerations

☐ Are they comfortable dealing with banks, lawyers, and government agencies?

☐ Can they manage financial matters competently?

☐ Will they be able to make difficult decisions if disputes arise?

☐ Are they geographically accessible to handle in-person tasks?

☐ Do they get along with your main beneficiaries?

☐ Are they likely to still be capable in 10, 20, 30 years?

---

## Potential Conflicts

*Consider whether your choice might create problems:*

☐ Is your executor also a major beneficiary? (common, but can create tension)

☐ If choosing one child, will siblings resent the choice?

☐ Does your executor have any conflict with other beneficiaries?

☐ Is your executor a business partner? (may have competing interests)

☐ Does your executor have strong opinions about your wishes?

---

## Your Executor Options

☐ **Spouse or partner** — common choice, but consider backup if they die with you

☐ **Adult child** — knows the family, but sibling dynamics may complicate

☐ **Trusted friend** — impartial, but may not know family circumstances

☐ **Sibling** — knows you well, but may have own interests

☐ **Professional** (solicitor or trustee company) — impartial and experienced, but charges fees

☐ **Co-executors** — shared responsibility, but must agree on decisions

---

## If Considering Co-Executors

☐ Can they work together cooperatively?

☐ Do they live close enough to meet when needed?

☐ Have you specified how they should resolve disagreements?

☐ Are you creating more complexity than necessary?

---

## Questions to Discuss With Your Chosen Executor

☐ Are they willing to act? (never assume)

☐ Do they understand the time commitment involved?

☐ Where will you store your will and how will they access it?

☐ Do they know your key contacts (solicitor, accountant, financial adviser)?

☐ Do they understand your wishes, especially anything unusual?

☐ Are there any family sensitivities they should know about?

---

## Backup Planning

☐ Have you named a substitute executor?

☐ What happens if your executor dies before you?

☐ What if they become incapacitated or unwilling to act?

☐ Is your backup also willing to act if needed?

---

## Things Your Executor Will Need to Know
