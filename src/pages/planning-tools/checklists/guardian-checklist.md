# Choosing a Guardian Checklist

**If you have children under 18, choosing a guardian is one of the most important decisions you'll make.** This is the person who would raise your children if both parents died. Use this checklist to think through your choice.

---

## Before You Start

☐ Does the other parent agree with your choice? (disagreement creates problems)

☐ Are you and the other parent making matching provisions?

☐ Have you considered that guardianship only applies if BOTH parents die?

---

## Essential Qualities

*Does your chosen guardian have:*

☐ Genuine willingness to take on the role (have you asked them?)

☐ Parenting values similar to yours

☐ Emotional capacity to raise additional children

☐ Stable home environment

☐ Good relationship with your children already

☐ Age and health to raise children for years to come

☐ Patience and temperament suited to children

---

## Practical Considerations

☐ Can they financially support additional children? (your estate may help, but not cover everything)

☐ Do they have space in their home, or would they need to move?

☐ Where do they live? Would your children need to change schools?

☐ Would your children need to move away from friends and extended family?

☐ Do they have their own children? How would yours fit in?

☐ What's their work situation? Do they have time for more children?

☐ Are they in a stable relationship, or single? (both can work)

---

## Values and Lifestyle

☐ Do they share your views on education (public/private/religious)?

☐ Do they share your religious or cultural values?

☐ Do they share your views on discipline and parenting style?

☐ Would they maintain relationships with both sides of your family?

☐ Do they have similar views on screen time, diet, activities?

☐ Would they support your children's existing interests and activities?

---

## Relationship Factors

☐ Do your children already know and like this person?

☐ Would they maintain connection to your children's current community?

☐ Would they keep your memory alive for your children?

☐ Can they handle the emotional needs of grieving children?

☐ Would they work with your family or shut them out?

---

## Your Guardian Options

☐ **Your parents** — know your family, but consider age and energy levels

☐ **Siblings** — often know your children well, similar family values

☐ **Close friends** — may share your values, but less family connection

☐ **Godparents** — if chosen for this reason, but relationship may have changed

☐ **Other relatives** — aunts, uncles, cousins

---

## Co-Guardians

*If considering a couple:*

☐ Are you appointing them as individuals or as a couple?

☐ What happens if they separate or divorce?

☐ What if one of them dies?

☐ Do both partners genuinely want this responsibility?

---

## Children with Special Needs

*Additional considerations:*

☐ Does the guardian understand your child's specific needs?

☐ Can they access appropriate services and support?

☐ Do they have experience with your child's condition?

☐ Is there a support network in their area?

☐ Have you provided for additional financial support through your will or trust?

---

## Questions to Discuss With Your Chosen Guardian

☐ Are they genuinely willing? (this is a huge commitment — give them time to think)

☐ Does their partner fully support the decision?

☐ What's their honest assessment of the challenges?

☐ Would they keep your children together or might they need to separate siblings?

☐ How would they handle contact with the other side of the family?

☐ What would they tell your children about you?

---

## Backup Planning

☐ Have you named an alternate guardian?

☐ What happens if your first choice can't act when needed?

☐ Does your alternate also understand they're the backup?

---

## Things to Document

*Not legally binding, but helpful guidance for your guardian:*

☐ Your children's routines and preferences

☐ Medical information and doctors

☐ School and activity contacts

☐ Important friendships to maintain

☐ Family traditions you'd like continued

☐ Your wishes for their education

☐ How you'd like your memory preserved

☐ Any specific concerns or guidance

---

## Difficult Situations to Consider

☐ What if a grandparent wants custody but isn't your choice?

☐ What if the other parent's family disagrees with your choice?

☐ What if your chosen guardian's circumstances change before they're needed?

☐ What if your children (especially older ones) want to live with someone else?

---

## Red Flags — Reconsider If:

☐ They're hesitant or reluctant when asked

☐ Their partner isn't fully supportive

☐ They have significant health problems

☐ They're already overwhelmed with their own responsibilities

☐ Your children don't have a relationship with them

☐ They live somewhere your children would be isolated from everyone they know

☐ They have very different values about things important to you

---

## What's Next?

Once you've chosen a guardian and confirmed they're willing, you can name them in your will.
