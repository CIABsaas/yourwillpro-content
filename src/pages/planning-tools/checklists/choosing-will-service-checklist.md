## Questions to Ask Any Provider

☐ What's included in the price?

☐ Pressure you to decide immediately

☐ Can't explain their pricing clearly

☐ Have no clear complaints or support process

☐ Won't let you see samples of their documents

☐ Have poor or no reviews

☐ Claim one will fits all situations

---

## Cost vs Risk Assessment

☐ What could a mistake cost your family? (delays, legal fees, disputes)

☐ What's the value of your estate?

☐ How much stress and complexity would an invalid will create?

☐ Is saving $200 worth the risk of getting it wrong?

---

## For Online Services, Check:

☐ Is the service Australian-based and compliant with Australian law?

☐ Are templates specific to your state?

☐ Is there clear information about when you should seek legal advice instead?

☐ What support is available (phone, chat, email)?

☐ Can you review and update your will later?

☐ Is there a satisfaction guarantee?

☐ How is your data protected?

---

## Making Your Decision

☐ Have you honestly assessed your complexity level?

☐ Does the option you're considering match your needs?

☐ Have you compared at least 2-3 options?

☐ Are you comfortable with the support available?

☐ Does the price represent fair value for what's included?
